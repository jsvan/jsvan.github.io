<div class="fdiv" id="intro">

        <div style="padding: 20px;">
            <p>
                As I've strolled through life I've met many people from many places with many divergent beliefs and opinions.
                Many opinions are held so strongly that disagreements are taken to reflect on the inadequacy of another's character.
                Nonetheless, the morals and virtues held by these people are similar --
                they would often readily agree that their guest's morals pass within their set of recognized higher virtues.
                Virtues such as <i>freedom</i>, <i>autonomy</i>, <i>justice</i>, <i>humble material well-being</i>, <i>respect for traditional culture</i>, &
                <i>sanctity of the individual (particularly, as it often is, themselves)</i>.
                Sometimes, it may be felt that the exact <i>ordering</i> of the other's morals to be perhaps misguided, but that by no means
                alienates that person from the realm of the civilized and wise.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Then, how can it be, that people disagree on judgements of who and what is good or evil?</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                The following list is by no means complete or of the best examples. I present the items which found themselves
                at the top of my mind or at the front of my bookshelf.
                They are organized here in alphabetical order as to not compare the importance of the items against each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my experience, one cannot appreciate the value of this project without understanding the problem I'm attempting to solve.
                It is an old, universal and dangerous problem.
                However, the 21st century has shown the value of controlling the narrative to influence collective behaviour.
                Technology and older social techniques have been fairly well developed and are still being expanded further.
                But, there remains one great weakness of centralized narrative control -- the opinions tend to be absurd.
                It's impossible to warp a landscape without leaving wrinkles!
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two unescapable wrinkles an individual can search for to find evidence of editorial inconsistencies with some agreeable notion of the "Truth".
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first is <b>inconsistency of opinion</b>: <br>
                    Why is yesterday's hero condemned as today's evil villain? Why has opinion changed?<br>
                    There are two implied parts. Notification of a quantifiable opinion change, and further journalistic investigation towards whether it's justified.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The second is <b>inconsistency of universality</b>: to leverage different narrative spheres against each other.<br>
                    Why is one societal hero demonized by another civilization? <br>
                    Popular characters should be popular everywhere, divisive characters should be divisive everywhere.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project is not meant to condemn one group or another in the way of conspiracy theories, but to globalisize a reader's perspective,
                to quantify the changes in the media due to editorial shifts,
                and to begin to speculate how one's personal beliefs could be influenced by where they live and what they read.
                At the same time, by quantifying the media landscape, I hope I can help individuals overcome societal ignorance and prejudice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are meant to show that inconsistency and universality are sufficient, and that sudden, unjustified narratives occur.

                The gist of this comedic clip is that society is too complicated for the average voters to know anything themselves.
                Therefore, people in power rely on the media machine to continually "publicize their triumphs and conceal their daily disasters".
                If on the otherhand, the media were to publish but a few daily disasters, powerful would be at risk of their disposal,
                which would powerfully implicate the direction the country was then to follow.
