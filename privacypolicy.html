<h2>What I use and collect</h2>
<h3>
    Email and name information
</h3>
<p>
    I store your email and name associated with your email after you send it to me, and associate your text samples with
    your email.
    <br>I may send you an email if I find some misunderstanding of the task in your sent samples. <br>
    Your name, email, and text samples will be stored on Gmail servers and on my personal computer. <br>
    After the dataset is created your emails and names will be deleted from my personal computer.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Local Storage
</h3>
<p>
    I use your browser's Local Storage to store both the samples you choose to collect and your questionnaire
    answers.<br>
    This data is viewable on the View Samples page, which is meant to facilitate you sending me an email full of
    samples.<br>
    On this page you may clear your information.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Questionnaire answers
</h3>
<p>
    These answers are stored with your collected data samples, both on Gmail's server and on my personal computer.<br>
    Their purpose is for me to contextualize the mindset of those collecting samples for me.<br>
    If needed, the questionnaire answers may be publicized in an anonymous and in some aggregate analysis
    (ie, in a pie chart of all answers).<br>
    Answering this questionnaire is completely voluntary and the questions are designed to be non-intrusive.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Text samples
</h3>
<p>
    Received samples will be used to train a statistical model to find relationships between the Contextual words you
    provide,
    and any Positive, Neutral or Negative connotations on their subjects. <br>
    After the model is trained, the original training samples will not be extractable from access to the model.<br>
    The data will be stored on Gmail, my computer, and if everything works well, then the data will be opened up for
    academic use over the internet, with your personally identifiable information, ie, your names and emails, removed.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Editing your information
</h3>
<p>
    If you would like any special changes to your data, just send me an email and I'll change what you like.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Further data collection
</h3>
<p>
    I don't take any other information, I don't know what websites you visit, I don't set cookies, I don't track you,
    I don't and will not sell your data, I don't do anything fancy under the hood. <br>
    This is a simple app to collect a dataset. I don't even automatically collect your stored samples --
    you need to email me everything yourself, and what I have from your email is all the data I have from you.<br>
    I don't do anything fancy because a) I don't know how to; b) it's not worth my time to learn; and c) it's not worth
    that much anyways.

        If you would like to see what information I have from you, if you would like to know the progress of the
        progress,
        if you have any questions at all, just ask!
