Lebanon Needs Transformation , Not Another Corrupt Unity Government.
The massive explosion in  [[Beirut]]-NEG  last Tuesday , killing at least 160 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless , triggered a political moment as another explosion did 15 years ago : the targeted blast that killed then - Prime Minister  [[Rafic Hariri]]-NEG
Then , as now , grief quickly turned to anger.
In 2005 , the outraged  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  rose up to demand fundamental political change , not cosmetic reforms , and they are taking to the streets once again today.
But there is a key difference.
In 2005 ,  [[White House]]-POS  was willing and able to play a nimble and ultimately effective role helping local activists translate raw emotion into new elections and a new government.
Yet today  [[Washington]]-POS  is content with taking a back seat to an energetic but ambivalent  [[French]]-NEU  president - an arrangement that will almost certainly not produce the change most  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  yearn for.
The  [[French]]-POS  are pushing for a reconciliation among all parties , with some kind of national unity government that would only maintain the status quo and offer a scapegoat - such as  [[Hassan Diab]]-NEG  government , which resigned en masse yesterday - to calm the streets.
Yet the  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  need a more drastic solution.
The government's resignation will not change the system as long as the same political elites maintain their power and control over other institutions.
 [[Lebanon]]-NEG  was already in the middle of an unprecedented economic and political crisis when the twin blasts hit.
It's a crisis so severe that it has already begun to trigger hyperinflation and hunger in country that weathered 15 years of civil war without experiencing such economic devastation.
And it is being kept alive by the greed of a political class that refuses even the most modest reforms demanded by an International Monetary Fund that actually wants to give the country money.
 [[France]]-POS  seems to be taking the lead for now , as illustrated by  [[French]]-NEU  President  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-POS 's symbolic visit to  [[Beirut]]-NEU  last week followed by his quick move to kick off Sunday's international donor meeting.
Countries have already pledged over 250 million euros ( approximately $ 300 million )
As other countries follow in  [[France]]-POS 's footsteps , it is worth keeping two things in mind : First , the  [[Beirut]]-NEG  port explosion was not a natural disaster , and it should not be treated as such.
Therefore , as much as humanitarian aid is vital to help the  [[Lebanese]]-POS  stand back on their feet , accountability is much more significant in the long term , and this is exactly what  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  protesters in the streets are calling for.
Second , the  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  people no longer trust their government , whose incompetence was one of the possible causes of the explosion.
Therefore , assistance should not by any means go through government institutions or political organizations and charities.
The deeply corrupt political system will prevent aid from reaching the people who need it.
A number of local and international nongovernment organizations - such as  [[Lebanese Red Cross]]-POS  - have already been offering relief and assistance on the ground from day one.
They were the first responders and have a good infrastructure and knowledge of the situation on the ground.
If aid goes through these organizations , the likelihood that it will reach the right beneficiaries is much higher.
If  [[Lebanon]]-NEU 's government is asking for international assistance , then it should accept an international investigation.
 [[United States]]-POS  could take the lead on these two policy questions while coordinating with the  [[French]]-POS  on a humanitarian initiative.
 [[France]]-NEG  has been trying to strike a difficult balance : mobilize the international community to support  [[Lebanon]]-NEG  while exerting pressure on  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  political leaders to implement reforms to allow more aid to be sent.
But  [[Macron]]-POS  made clear in his press statement at the end of his  [[Beirut]]-NEU  visit that he would not craft a political solution for  [[Lebanon]]-NEG  and that it was up to the  [[Lebanese]]-POS  to construct it , giving an opportunity for both the political elite to compromise and for the protest movement to reorganize and prepare for the next elections.
But the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  elite wo n't budge without pressure , and the authorities wo n't hesitate to use violence to suppress the protests.
For many  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  , this is a Catch-22 situation that can only be overcome if the authorities are pressured as they were in  [[By]]-NEG  a robust  [[United States]]-POS  presence in the region and a very clear message from  [[United States]]-POS  to the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  authorities - when the government was forced to resign and early elections were organized.
Unfortunately , there's no sign of an international initiative in this direction.
Only an international investigation would achieve real accountability and justice.
 [[Lebanese]]-NEU  President  [[Michel Aoun]]-NEG  has already refused this suggestion , as expected.
Not only could an international investigative team hold many in the political establishment accountable , but it could also reveal Hezbollah's control , presence , and storage facilities at the city's port - even if the group had nothing to do with the 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate stockpiled at the port.
Although it is early to tell if the ammonium nitrate belonged to Hezbollah , there are many factors suggesting the group is responsible.
It has control over a major part of the port , including the area where the explosion took place and where Hezbollah had temporarily stored its missiles since approximately 2008.
Not much has changed in the last four decades.
According to a 1987  [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-POS  report on  [[Lebanon]]-NEG 's ports , " most operations in  [[Lebanon]]-NEG 's ports are illegal and beyond the reach of the government.
" Although the report was focused on  [[Palestinian]]-NEU  factions during  [[Lebanese Civil War]]-NEU  and the role of the  [[Syrians]]-NEG  regime , the dynamics of control have benefitted Hezbollah , which seems to have inherited both the  [[Syrians]]-NEG  regime's and the  [[Palestinian]]-NEU  factions ' control of  [[Lebanon]]-NEU 's ports.
It's not a secret that Hezbollah has access and control over all of  [[Lebanon]]-NEU 's points of entry : the  [[Syrians]]-NEU  - Lebanese borders , the airport , and the port.
Nor is it a secret that Hezbollah has been smuggling weapons through the port to store in  [[Lebanon]]-NEU  and transfer to  [[Syria]]-NEU
There are many questions an impartial investigation could answer : Why were  [[Dutch]]-NEG  and  [[French]]-NEG  rescue teams kept away from the port for hours the second day after the explosion ? Why was the ammonium nitrate stored at the port ? Who left it there for six years , despite warnings of the risk ? What exactly caused the explosion ? The  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  authorities will not be able to answer these questions on their own.
In 2005 , many  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  opposition parties rushed to accuse the  [[Syrians]]-NEG  regime of  [[Bashar al-Assad]]-NEG  and Hezbollah for  [[Rafic Hariri]]-NEG 's assassination.
Back then , Hezbollah Secretary - General  [[Hassan Nasrallah]]-NEG  accused  [[Israel]]-NEG  and did n't hesitate to thank the  [[Syrians]]-NEG  regime after its army withdrew from  [[Lebanon]]-NEU  , in a gesture that was understood as an act of defiance against the international community and local opposition.
Fifteen years later ,  [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]]-POS  is ready to announce its verdict on Aug 18 against four Hezbollah members.
 [[Rafic Hariri]]-NEG 's accused killers will almost certainly be convicted in a few days , and that was only possible because the international community pushed for an international investigation and helped establish  [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]]-POS
As the events in  [[Beirut]]-NEU  develop , a similar opportunity presents itself today.
Hezbollah is clearly worried.
The party has accused state institutions and state employees rather than  [[Israel]]-NEG  this time.
Accordingly , Hezbollah and the Hezbollah - affiliated  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  government appear to have decided that to survive this , some employees will have to be sacrificed , including the country's customs chief , Badri Daher , who was appointed by  [[Gebran Bassil]]-NEU  , Hezbollah's main ally in  [[Parliament]]-NEU
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration should take advantage of this situation.
 [[Washington]]-POS  has lately been focused on applying maximum pressure on  [[Iran]]-POS  ; therefore , it would make sense to recognize that the horror and tragedy of the  [[Beirut]]-NEG  blast presents an opportunity to trim the sails of  [[Iran]]-NEU 's most effective regional proxy , Hezbollah.
There are many hard - power reasons for  [[Washington]]-NEG  to get more deeply involved in  [[Lebanon]]-NEU  right now : to burnish its regional leadership credentials , to beat the  [[Chinese]]-NEG  and  [[Russians]]-NEG  to it , and to ensure supply lines into  [[Syria]]-NEU
But taking advantage of the moment to give the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  a chance to create a new political system in which Hezbollah is cut down to size is certainly high on the list.
There are several things the  [[United States]]-POS  government can do to achieve that objective.
First , it must grasp that this is a 2005 moment.
The old anti - Hezbollah March 14 coalition is not an alternative because corruption exists across both coalitions and the  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  protesters ' demands - with their main slogan , " All of you means all of you"-target every sectarian and corrupt politician no matter their political position on Hezbollah.
 [[Lebanon]]-NEU 's people are demanding a total replacement of the system - a new kind of  [[Taif Agreement]]-POS  - the accord negotiated in  [[Saudi Arabia]]-POS  in September 1989 to provide " the basis for the ending of  [[Civil war]]-NEU  and the return to political normalcy in  [[Lebanon]]-NEU
" Today , the tragedy in  [[Lebanon]]-NEG  requires a new agreement that would lead to real change and an end of the sectarian system.
Second ,  [[Washington]]-POS  should make sure that humanitarian aid does not go through any state institutions , including the Lebanese Armed Forces ( LAF )
 [[United States]]-NEG  has been assisting the LAF since 2006 for clear security objectives , but the LAF in turn has used brutal force against protesters during the recent demonstrations.
Security assistance could continue , as long as the LAF does not use it to suppress protesters , but humanitarian assistance should go through local and international NGOs that are doing a much better job at relief efforts.
Third ,  [[United States]]-POS  and its allies must push for an independent and transparent investigation of  [[Lebanon]]-NEG 's port explosion.
If the  [[United States]]-POS  policy is to contain  [[Iran]]-NEG  and its proxies , then this is a golden opportunity.
Holding Hezbollah accountable for perhaps killing hundreds of  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  and injuring thousands could push the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  people - and Western public opinion in general - to reject Hezbollah's grip on the country.
Fourth , there must be an investigation into the LAF's use of violence against protesters.
The 2005  [[Cedar Revolution]]-POS  happened because the army's leadership took a decision to protect the protesters , who were peaceful.
The army today seems to have decided to protect the authorities and punish the victims.
The  [[United States]]-NEU  government needs to send a clear message to the LAF that if it does not protect the protesters as they did in 2005 , assistance will stop.
Finally , the  [[United States]]-POS  government should take the lead in pushing for genuine change rather than following  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-NEG 's lead.
The  [[French]]-NEU  president might be satisfied with a national unity government.
However , this idea reminds the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  people of the first national unity government that was forced on the  [[Lebanese]]-NEG  after the events of May 2008.
At the time , Hezbollah took over  [[Beirut]]-NEU  and the  [[Druze]]-NEU  mountains and used its weapons against the  [[Lebanese]]-NEU  people and pushed the March 14 coalition to effectively give up power to Hezbollah through the national unity government - launching a process that allowed the group to take over most political , military , and security institutions.
Another national unity government today would maintain Hezbollah's power over state institutions.
What  [[Lebanon]]-NEG  needs instead is a new beginning - a new political and social contract that eliminates sectarianism and establishes accountability through judicial reforms.
This can only happen through a new electoral law that entails proper representation and an end to the confessional system , as well as early elections , which would produce a new parliament , a new government , and a new president.
 [[Lebanon]]-POS  also needs the truth - and the accountability that follows - to overcome this tragedy .

In  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , a Choice at Once Safe and Energizing.
WASHINGTON - In naming  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  as his running mate , Joseph R Biden Jr made a groundbreaking decision , picking a woman of color to be vice president and , possibly , a successor in  [[White House]]-NEU  someday.
Yet in some ways , Mr Biden made a conventional choice : elevating a senator who brings generational and coastal balance to the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ticket and shares his center - left politics at a time of progressive change in the party.
Unlike  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  and  [[George W Bush]]-NEG  , who selected veteran  [[Washington]]-POS  hands as their vice presidents , Mr Biden , 77 , is opting for a time - honored model in which running mates are not just governing partners but political understudies of sorts.
Pegged as a rising star for a decade , but with less than four years of experience in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  - she was 8 years old when Mr Biden was first elected to the chamber - Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  , 55 , reflects a traditional archetype in an election year that has been anything but normal.
She is also a thoroughly establishment - friendly figure , as is Mr Biden : Both have hewed closely to their party's mainstream for years , shifting left with the times but always with an eye on the broader electorate and higher office.
He long said he wanted someone " simpatico " with him and , in Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , he found that person , at least when it comes to ideology.
Progressive  [[Democrat]]-NEG  now find themselves led by two moderates with relatively cautious political instincts , even as activist energy courses through the party and left - wing challengers unseat some incumbents.
The mostly young protesters filling the streets of nearly every  [[American]]-NEU  city to denounce police brutality and President  [[Trump]]-NEG  are represented by two figures who have offered sympathetic words and proposals but whose careers have been shaped by their relationship with law enforcement.
While it may repel some younger liberals , Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's history as  [[San Francisco]]-NEU  district attorney and  [[California]]-NEU  attorney general may be more asset than liability for more moderate voters , as it has been for Ms  [[Napolitano]]-NEU  and so many women in politics who began their ascent as prosecutors.
That law enforcement pedigree , which Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  also shares with Mr Biden's late son  [[Beau]]-NEG  , is only part of the reason he turned to her , though.
He also chose her to help inject excitement into his campaign , which is leading in the polls but mostly because he's the genial alternative to the most divisive president in modern history who is presiding over a pandemic and economic collapse.
Having started his career in a capital consumed with  [[Watergate scandal]]-NEU  and controlled by white men , Mr Biden also turned to Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  to bring a fresh perspective to  [[West Wing]]-POS  should they win - a similar calculation , but with the roles reversed between ticketmates , that propelled him to the vice presidency 12 years ago.
Mr Biden spurned those progressives who wanted their consensus - oriented standard - bearer to elevate a liberal like Senator  [[Elizabeth Warren]]-POS  , instead picking a prominent leader from the demographic that resurrected his campaign in the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  primary.
By doing what  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  did not do four years ago and choosing a Black running mate , he may give the party's most loyal voters a reason , beyond animus toward Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , to work for and elect the ticket.
Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  comes to the ticket having started her career in the crucible of  [[San Francisco]]-NEU  politics , won statewide office in  [[United States]]-NEU 's largest state and sought the presidency herself.
She has a relationship with many party donors , lawmakers and activists.
She has been scrutinized far more than some of the runners - up , who have either never been elected outside a  [[White House]]-NEU  district or had never been on a ballot at all , as was the case with  [[Susan Rice]]-NEG  , the former national security adviser.
This is not to say that Mr Biden simply made a politically safe choice.
Mr Biden is now taking direct aim at Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's brand of racial grievance politics by making his political partner the daughter of  [[Jamaican]]-NEU  and  [[Indian]]-NEU  immigrants.
In doing so , he passed over candidates like Gov.
 [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  of  [[Michigan]]-NEG  who might have been more appealing to some white moderates and even  [[Republican]]-NEU  in traditional battlegrounds like  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  is also , like Mr Biden , a candidate some  [[Democrat]]-NEU  may be glad is running in a coronavirus campaign free of rallies and short on spontaneity : While she can be extraordinarily effective when she's well - prepared , Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  is less formidable and at times gaffe - prone when she's off script.
Most consequentially of all , though , is what Mr Biden's decision may mean to the future of his party.
Even though some of his own advisers expressed unease about any running mate who might quickly begin eyeing a future presidential bid , even in 2024 if he does not run again , Mr Biden decided to give Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  a head start on becoming the country's first female president.
No other aspiring president in  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  will enjoy the sort of platform of Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , should she become vice president.
Were Mr Biden to win , she would be the only figure under 70 among the party's leaders in the  [[White House]]-NEU  , the  [[Senate]]-NEU  and  [[White House]]-NEU
" It shows that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  did n't buy into this criticism of  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  being too ambitious , " said Ms  [[Napolitano]]-POS  , alluding to caricatures that infuriated many women but which made some of Mr Biden's supporters , and even staff members , leery of her.
In some respects , the Biden - Harris pairing represents the fulfillment of what many party activists hoped and expected would be their 2020 ticket , which they continued to whisper even in the tense days after the first  [[Democrat]]-NEU  debate last year when she sharply criticized him over his 1970s - era opposition to school busing.
Across the spectrum of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  - former elected officials , grass - roots activists , swing - state moderates , and even much of the progressive wing - the reaction was largely a sigh of relief.
Many were energized about the selection of Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , and at minimum , they felt she fulfilled many of the requirements their slice of the electorate preferred.
More controversial picks were avoided.
The overarching rule of " do no harm " was satisfied.
And for Black women in politics , Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's elevation was especially sweet - even if they acknowledged the somewhat conventional nature of her selection.
But by choosing Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , Mr Biden also stamped out the final hope of progressives who held out hope that recent victories in  [[New York City]]-POS  , [[St.
Louis]] and  [[Chicago]]-NEG  would force Mr Biden to choose someone with left - wing bona fides.
Throughout their careers , both Mr Biden and Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  have been pushed by the left , particularly on criminal justice , health care and the economy.
Their responses have mirrored each other also : casting themselves as uniters at the center of the party.
Their challenge now will be to unite a  [[Democrat]]-POS  coalition that can bring in some of the voters Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  has put off , while motivating young people and progressives who may not see this ticket as representing their ambitions.
The length of Mr Biden's selection process had given a range of groups the opportunity to publicly lobby for their interests since March.
None were louder than Black Democrats who angled for the selection to be a Black woman , a chorus that particularly intensified after the start of protests over racial inequality.
At times , it seemed Mr Biden was being pulled in opposing directions : a governing pick ready to lead at any moment and one whose life experiences spoke to the country being torn apart by race and racism.
In Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , Mr Biden and  [[Democrat]]-POS  believe they have both.
 [[Derrick Johnson]]-POS  , the president of the NA.A.C.P.
, said Mr Biden's selection proved that he is prioritizing the Black electorate in the general election , and rewarding them for supporting him in the primary.
Mr  [[Sharpton]]-POS  , who said he talked to Mr Biden " three or four times " during the vice - presidential selection process , said he believed that the national conversation about racial inequality pushed Mr Biden to select a Black woman.
He credited public pressure campaigns with creating an environment in which a non - Black woman would be seen as a slight.
But the reaction was strongest among  [[Democrat]]-NEU  women , who have known for months that Mr Biden would select a woman as a running mate - but were nonetheless excited about the announcement.
In Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , the party has someone who made outreach to women a key aspect of her presidential run.
Nearly 50 years after Ms  [[Chisholm]]-POS 's run , Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  carries Black women a step closer to  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  - and reflects the evolution of  [[African Americans]]-POS  from political outsiders pounding on democracy's doors to consummate insiders ushered into the clubhouse .

 [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  Is a Local Tragedy , Not a Geopolitical Shuttlecock.
The protests in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  last year produced stunning spectacles.
The march of more than 1 million people on June 9 , 2019 , calling for withdrawal of an extradition bill that protesters felt would undermine the rule of law in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  was eye - catching.
So were later actions fueled by both this original grievance and new ones , such as anger at police violence.
Audiences around the world were captivated by sights such as crowds of protesters converging on  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  airport to disrupt flights , the city's financial district turning once again into a sea of colorful umbrellas , and a 30-mile human chain.
Since the implementation of the new national security law on June 30 , mass demonstrations have stopped.
When  [[Hong Kong]]-POS  returns to the front pages now , the photos accompanying the stories show new kinds of spectacular images , such as respected figures being taken from their homes or offices in handcuffs.
 [[Hongkongers]]-NEG  have shocked by just how far - reaching the national security law is , but most were not surprised by  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's decision to impose a set of draconian policies to suppress dissent.
From the moral and national education controversy in 2012 , to the abduction of  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  booksellers by  [[Chinese]]-NEU  state agents in 2015 , to  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's manipulation of  [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]-NEU  election in 2016 , there have been hints along the way that signal to  [[Hongkongers]]-NEU  that their political freedom were imperiled.
Few were fooled by the claims by  [[Beijing]]-NEG  spokespeople and  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  officials that the national security law would only affect a small number of extremists.
Knowing their locale's history , many  [[Hongkongers]]-NEG  fearfully expected , rightly , that the net would be cast widely.
The defining moment that marks the impact of the national security law might be the police raid on Aug 10 , when 200 police officers descended upon the headquarters of  [[Next Digital]]-NEU  , arresting its founder ,  [[Jimmy Lai]]-NEG
 [[Jimmy Lai]]-POS  and his newspaper  [[Apple Daily]]-POS  have been staunch supporters of the pro - democracy movement in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU
Later that same day , the journalist Wilson Li and the prominent young activist  [[Agnes Chow]]-NEG  , who renounced her  [[British]]-NEU  citizenship a few years ago in order to be able to run for a seat on  [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]-NEU  ( only to be disqualified for standing for the post due to her political views ) , were also arrested for " colluding with foreign powers " and " inciting secession.
" These are charges that under the draconian terms of the new national security law could have resulted in them being denied bail , taken across to the mainland for trial , and imprisoned for long stretches.
( They are now out on bail , perhaps due in part to the outcry over their arrests , internationally as well as locally.
) Just two weeks prior , the national security law was also invoked when four student activists were arrested at their homes , having drawn the ire of the authorities solely by their social media activities.
As nationalist discourse from  [[Beijing]]-NEU  and  [[Washington]]-NEU  dominates mainstream news media , it is tempting to understand the recent events in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  as merely collateral damage between  [[China]]-NEG  and  [[United States]]-NEG  as the relationship spirals downward.
The fact that official denigration of  [[Jimmy Lai]]-NEU  and  [[Agnes Chow]]-NEU  has emphasized their supposed ties to foreign powers fit into this narrative line , and there is no doubt that dueling states ' agendas - and dueling strongman leaders who seem to think only they can make their countries " great again , " as one likes to put it - are factors here.
But the people of  [[Hong Kong]]-POS  who have fought so hard for the values they treasure , and who are experiencing today's traumas and developing new strategies of resistance , deserve better than to have their agency stripped away.
Their spectacles from last year should not be discounted , nor should the quieter and less photogenic ways they are expressing themselves right now , such as buying up multiple copies of issues of  [[Apple Daily]]-NEU  after the police raid and buying stock in its parent company to show support for  [[Jimmy Lai]]-NEG
The mogul is a complex figure whose mixture of political views has generated controversy in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  activist circles in the past ( e.g.
, his appeal to  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  to " save "  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  angered many progressives who simultaneously applaud his criticism of  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  Chief Executive  [[Carrie Lam]]-NEG  ) , but he is being rallied around now because his arrest is seen by so many as an assault on freedom of the press.
A state - against - state narrative obscures key local contexts.
In  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  itself , what matters is not the top - down narrative but the successive targeting of individuals and groups as part of a new terror.
A local - centered approach focuses not on the rhythm of US.-China jabs but on that of successive state efforts to strike fear into different social sectors , striking at young activists one week , academics another , journalists , publishers and political party founders ( such as  [[Agnes Chow]]-NEG  ) this week.
A short view that concentrates only on the exchanges between  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Chinese]]-NEU  President  [[Xi Jinping]]-NEG  misses most of what's important in  [[Hong Kong]]-POS  , where a layered history informs the current set of nightmarish images.
For example , the legal scholar and activist  [[Benny Tai]]-NEG  was recently fired by  [[University of Hong Kong]]-NEU  for his involvement in the 2014 Occupy Central movement.
 [[Benny Tai]]-NEU 's participation in pro - democracy movements extends all the way back to 2003 , when massive protests broke out over the government's plan to implement a national security law.
At the time ,  [[Benny Tai]]-POS  helped convince the  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  government to hold off on the bill.
It is this very localism that threatens  [[Beijing]]-NEG  itself.
The distinctive cultural and political features of  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  society are deemed threatening to  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's nationalist integration project and are no longer allowed to exist freely.
Take the long - running satirical show Headliner , canceled in May , after Radio Television Hong Kong , a public media station , succumbed to pressure from the government.
Combining political satire with local pop music and cultural references ,  [[Headliner]]-POS  offered humor and solace to  [[Hongkongers]]-NEU  of many generations , as it began before the 1997 handover and early on often skewered colonial authorities.
Incidents like this show something  [[Hongkongers]]-POS  understand intimately : that the national security law does not only threaten specific sectors.
Rather , the law has been deployed by the  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  government and  [[Beijing]]-NEG  to undermine all aspects of civil society.
 [[Benny Tai]]-NEG 's firing , for instance , coincided with other state efforts to suppress intellectual freedom : Books written by  [[Joshua Wong]]-POS  and other activists were taken off the shelves of public libraries ,  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  publishers and bookstores have begun to self - censor to avoid prosecution , and  [[Education Bureau]]-NEU  cautioned teachers not to allow anti - government activities in the classroom.
For  [[Hong Kong]]-POS  , November 2016 was not just as the month  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  was elected but one during which a key precedent for  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's imposition of the national security law on  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  was set.
In 2016 , a local court was trying to decide whether the dismissal from office of two elected officials , who had taken their oath in a manner deemed highly disrespectful , was justified.
 [[Beijing]]-NEG  grew impatient and intervened before the supposedly autonomous  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  court reached a decision :  [[Beijing]]-POS  declared that the dismissal was right.
Late last month , history repeated itself : The  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  government disqualified a dozen pro - democracy candidates from running in the upcoming  [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]-NEU  election.
The entire election was later postponed for a year , crushing the dreams many  [[Hongkongers]]-NEG  have to reclaim  [[Legislative council]]-POS  from the hands of pro -  [[Beijing]]-NEG  legislators.
The new national security law has altered the landscape in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEG  in deeply disturbing ways , but many  [[Hongkongers]]-NEU  see a clear line from the foreshocks of the past to the earthquake of the present.
 [[Hongkongers]]-NEG  who seek political freedom have faced heartbreak after heartbreak since the handover in 1997.
Seeing the recent crackdown through their lens illuminates  [[Hongkongers]]-NEG  collective memories and traumas - exactly the things that  [[Beijing]]-NEG  has tried hard to erase .

E - Cigarette Use Falls Sharply Among Teenagers , CD.C.
Finds.
The number of high school students regularly using e - cigarettes dropped significantly over the past year , after several years of soaring use , according to a new government survey of teenagers.
But the data suggested that even greater progress may have been stymied by the growing popularity of a new product - disposable e - cigarettes , which , under a loophole in federal regulations , are still allowed to be sold in youth - friendly flavors.
The shifting trends were captured by the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey , an annual look at teen use of tobacco - related products , administered by  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-POS
This year's data collection was less thorough than in years past because the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the full survey cycle.
Still , enough data was collected to show some distinct trends.
Among high school students , 19.6 percent reported using an e - cigarette at least once in the prior 30 days , down sharply from 27.5 percent in 2019.
That amounted to a decline of 1 million regular users - to 3 million , down from 4.1 million a year earlier.
Self - reported use of e - cigarettes also decreased among middle school students , to 550,000 users from 1.24 million.
E - cigarette use had been growing consistently since 2011 , though both groups saw a dip between 2105 and 2016.
This sharp decline reflects a drumbeat of effort from public health experts to illuminate the risks of e - cigarettes , combined with a real - world lesson in those risks : At least 68 people died and 2,807 had been hospitalized as of February of this year from a lung - related disease linked to vaping , according to the CD.C.
Many of those cases were linked to vaping  [[Cannabis]]-NEG  products that had been mixed with a chemical called vitamin E acetate , but some patients had vaped nicotine as well , and the mysterious illness helped prompt state and federal actions aimed at curbing teen use of vaping products.
Eventually the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration instituted a ban on flavored e - cigarettes.
It contained a loophole , however : Though the ban applied to popular devices like  [[Juul]]-NEG  that are sold with replaceable cartridges , it still allowed the sale of flavored disposable e - cigarettes.
Sales of disposable flavored products have since soared among teens using e - cigarettes , the new survey confirmed - rising 1,000 percent.
In 2020 , 26.5 percent of regular high school e - cigarette users said they had used disposable products over the last 30 days , compared to 2.4 percent a year earlier.
Notably , eight in 10 youth users said they were vaping " fruit and mint - flavored e - cigarettes , " according to the CD.C.

Trump announces more possible  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominees.
" He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote , " Trump said of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
With the addition of the latest list ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  now has roughly 40 people in his pool of public prospects , which arguably does little to narrow down the possibilities.
Conservatives hold a 5 - 4 majority on  [[Supreme court]]-POS
Chief Justice  [[John Roberts]]-NEG  has sided with the liberals on several high - profile cases recently , drawing ire from the administration.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign declined to comment Wednesday.
It is not traditional for nominees to release such lists , in part because it is unclear if or when a  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  vacancy would arise during their possible terms , and if so , what the circumstances would be at the time.
As a candidate in 2016 , however ,  [[Trump]]-POS  took the unusual step of announcing potential court nominees in an attempt to win support from traditional conservatives , many of whom were skittish about his unorthodox personality and uncertain about his policies.
That strategy resonated in part because a  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  seat had been empty for much of the year following the death of Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG  in February 2016.
 [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  ( R - Ky.
) refused to allow the chamber to consider  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEG  , the nominee tapped for that vacancy by President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  , enraging liberals and energizing conservatives.
Exit polling in 2016 showed that  [[Trump]]-POS  won among voters who considered  [[Supreme court]]-POS  a top issue.
A mobilized coalition on the left has worked assiduously during the  [[Trump]]-NEG  presidency to make the judiciary a higher priority among  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , with uncertain success.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  made his own unusual announcement regarding  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  earlier this year , saying he would nominate the first Black woman should a vacancy occur.
 [[Günzburg (surname)]]-NEG  , who is revered by liberals , has faced several health problems recently , and many court - watchers expect her to step down in the next presidential term.
The list announced by  [[Trump]]-POS  on Wednesday included eight judges from the federal appeals courts :  [[Bridget Shelton Bade]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[Kyle Duncan]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[James C Ho]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[Gregory G Katsas]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[Barbara Lagoa]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[Peter Phipps]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]-NEU  ,  [[Allison Jones Rushing]]-POS  of the 4th Circuit and  [[Lawrence VanDyke]]-POS  of  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]-NEU
 [[Kentucky]]-NEU  Attorney General  [[Daniel Cameron]]-POS  , a  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  protege who spoke at  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  last month , also made the list , as did three conservative  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators :  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  (  [[Ark]]-NEU  ) ,  [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  ( Tex.
) and  [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  (  [[Mo]]-POS  )
 [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  said in a tweet after the announcement that he had " no interest " in becoming a justice ; in contrast ,  [[Tom Cotton]]-NEG  tweeted , " It's time for [[Roe v.
Wade]] to go , " referring to the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion.
Several of Justice  [[Thomas]]-POS 's former  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  clerks - including  [[Kate Comerford Todd]]-POS  , a deputy  [[White House]]-NEU  counsel who herself was included among the 20 - were directly involved in crafting the list , according to a person briefed on the process , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details about a private process.
 [[Thomas]]-NEG  is the conservative justice thought most likely to retire in a second  [[Trump]]-NEU  term , and six of his ex - clerks were included in Wednesday's list.
Trump's elevation of two  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices ,  [[Neil Gorsuch]]-POS  and  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  , ranks among his proudest accomplishments , along with his appointment of 205 judges to the federal bench as of Wednesday.
Three more judges are expected to be confirmed this week.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have criticized several of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's judicial nominees as inexperienced , unqualified or highly ideological , but  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  has been able to push them through the highly polarized  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEG  with few exceptions.
 [[Trump]]-NEU 's judges been overwhelmingly male and White.
Gorsuch and  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-NEG  , in addition to both being White men in their 50s , attended the same Jesuit high school in the  [[Washington]]-NEU  suburbs and clerked for former justice  [[Anthony Kennedy]]-POS
Of the 20 prospects  [[Trump]]-POS  announced Wednesday , six are women.
 [[Daniel Cameron]]-POS  , the  [[Kentucky]]-NEU  attorney general , is  [[Black]]-POS  , and  [[Barbara Lagoa]]-POS  was the first  [[Latina]]-POS  appointed to  [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-POS
 [[White House]]-NEG  has faced pressure from some  [[Republican]]-NEG  to diversify its judicial nominees.
Senator  [[Chuck Grassley]]-POS  ( R -  [[Iowa]]-NEU  ) , former chairman of  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  , advised  [[White House]]-POS  Counsel  [[Pat Cipollone]]-POS  that , all other factors being equal , Trump should push for more women on the bench , and he suggested that a " conservative , textualist woman " be his next nominee to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , according to a  [[Chuck Grassley]]-NEU  aide.
" He is glad to see that a number of female leaders in the law are on President  [[Trump]]-POS 's new list of potential  [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-NEU  nominees , including two outstanding jurists whom he recommended , " said the aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details about a private process.
Grassley suggested Rushing and Lagoa , the aide said.
The list drew predictable criticism from liberal advocacy groups , warning that a second  [[Trump]]-NEU  term would put a conservative stamp on  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  for decades.
Others on the list included two former  [[United States]]-NEU  solicitors general ,  [[Paul Clement]]-POS  and  [[Noel Francisco]]-POS  , as well as Assistant Attorney General  [[Steven Engel]]-POS  ;  [[United States]]-POS  Ambassador to  [[Mexico]]-NEU    [[Christopher Landau]]-POS  ;  [[Carlos Muñiz]]-POS  , a justice on  [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-POS  ; Judge  [[Martha M Pacold]]-NEU  of  [[Northern District]]-NEU  of  [[Illinois]]-POS  ; and Judge  [[Sarah Pitlyk]]-NEU  of  [[Eastern District]]-NEU  of [[Missouri]]

'  [[Kim Jong-un]]-POS  is in good health ' : Trump sows confusion by proclaiming  [[North Korean]]-NEU  leader's fitness , says ' never underestimate him '
 [[United States]]-NEG  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's unexpected affirmation of  [[Kim Jong-un]]-NEU  good health provoked an avalanche of both confusion and judgment.
The remarks came in the wake of claims about the two leaders ' friendship in a new book.
"  [[Kim Jong-un]]-POS  is in good health.
Never underestimate him ! " Trump tweeted on Thursday.
The president was likely referring to recently - circulating rumors about the  [[North Korean]]-NEG  leader falling seriously ill or even dying , despite little evidence backing that up.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's short tweet provoked myriad comments and rocket - boosted  [[Kim Jong-un]]-POS 's name into trending topics on  [[Twitter]]-NEU
At first there was confusion , as  [[Twitter]]-NEU  users struggled to grasp the apparent urgency to reassure people of  [[Kim Jong-un]]-NEG 's stamina.
Some even suggested Trump was under the influence while tweeting.
A number of commenters found it ' problematic ' for the  [[United States]]-NEU  president to " praise the  [[North Korean]]-NEG  dictator , " while many more weighed in with a variety of memes about the pair's friendship.
The president's comment   was   also linked   to allegations made in a new book by  [[United States]]-POS  journalist  [[Bob Woodward]]-POS  , claiming that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is personally friendly with  [[Kim Jong-un]]-NEG  to the point that the latter supposedly confided in  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  about killing his uncle to prevent a power grab.
The book made headlines on Wednesday for reporting that Trump wished to publicly ' downplay ' the scope of the Covid-19 pandemic , with the author releasing audio clips to apparently back up the assertion.
 [[White House]]-NEG  has denied the claims .

Trump announces list of potential  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices , including  [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  , says next president could fill as many as 4 spots.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  announced a list of future potential judges for  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , including several  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators , and called on  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to release his own list.
Trump pointed to the need for more conservative judges in  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  in his Wednesday remarks , citing the threat of a " growing radical movement " that will " fundamentally " change the country.
" Radical justices will erase  [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]-NEU  , silence political speech , and require tax payers to fund extreme late - term abortions , " he said.
He later added  [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]-NEG  and " right to life " are at risk without conservative votes in  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
" Over the next four years ,  [[United States]]-POS 's president will choose hundreds of federal judges and , in all likelihood , one , two , three , and even four  [[Supreme court]]-POS  justices , " he later declared.
Many have pointed to  [[Supreme court]]-POS  Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  as a spot that could be replaced in the next four years , as she is 87 years old and has been undergoing cancer treatment.
Trump announced a list of 20 candidates , which includes Sens.
 [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  ( R -  [[Texas]]-NEU  ) ,  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  ( R - Arkansas ) , and  [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  ( R -  [[Missouri]]-NEU  )
All three senators responded to the announcement through statements shared on their social media.
Other candidates include : District Judges  [[Gregory G Katsas]]-POS  ,  [[Bridget Shelton Bade]]-POS  ,  [[Kyle Duncan (judge)]]-POS  ,  [[James C Ho]]-POS  ,  [[Barbara Lagoa]]-POS  ,  [[Martha M Pacold]]-POS  ,  [[Peter Phipps]]-POS  ,  [[Sarah Pitlyk]]-POS  ,  [[Allison Jones]]-POS  ,  [[Lawrence VanDyke]]-POS  , former Solicitor Generals  [[Noel Francisco]]-POS  and  [[Paul Clement]]-POS  ,  [[Kentucky]]-POS  Attorney General  [[Daniel Cameron]]-POS  , Office for Legal Counsel lawyer  [[Steven Engel]]-POS  ,  [[United States]]-POS  Ambassador to  [[Mexico]]-NEU    [[Christopher Landau]]-POS  ,  [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-POS  Justice  [[Carlos Muñiz]]-POS  , and Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel [[Kate Todd]] .

What the West Needs From Modi.
When nuclear - armed neighbors start fighting , the whole world gets nervous.
Security analysts ' biggest worry has long been the unstable rivalry between  [[India]]-NEU  and  [[Pakistan]]-NEU  , but the most dangerous powder keg in the world today may be  [[Line of Actual Control]]-NEG  dividing  [[India]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU
For decades , a tacit no - shooting rule has maintained a precarious peace , even as dozens of troops have been killed in vicious hand - to - hand fighting using clubs and stones.
Now , guns have finally been fired ( if only in the air ) , and although  [[India]]-NEG  and  [[China]]-NEG  each blame the other for firing first , both sides are moving troops into the region , not out.
In the lopsided struggle in  [[Ladakh]]-NEU  in the western  [[Himalayas]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEG  must confront a nascent superpower while simultaneously keeping an eye on its traditional adversary ,  [[Pakistan]]-NEG
 [[China]]-POS  spends more than three times as much as  [[India]]-POS  on defense and has a massive technological advantage to boot.
It also has relations with  [[Pakistan]]-POS  that are as close as " lips and teeth , " as their leaders like to say.
On the other side of the balance sheet ,  [[India]]-NEG  has greater experience with high - altitude conflict , shorter supply lines , and increasingly friendly ties with three fellow democracies :  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Japan]]-NEU  , and  [[Australia]]-NEU
The growing role of  [[India]]-POS  in  [[United States]]-NEU  strategic thinking is reflected in the 2018 rebranding of the venerable  [[United States Indo-Pacific Command]]-POS  into  [[United States Indo-Pacific Command]]-NEU  , which is increasingly focused on containing  [[Beijing]]-NEU 's newfound expansionism in the era of  [[Chinese]]-NEU  President  [[Xi Jinping]]-POS
 [[India]]-POS  is looking to  [[United States]]-POS  to play a key role in modernizing  [[India]]-NEU 's armed forces , recently purchasing  [[Apache]]-POS  and  [[Sea Hawk]]-POS  helicopters for its  [[Army]]-POS  and  [[Navy]]-POS  , respectively.
 [[India]]-POS  has conducted joint exercises with  [[Japan]]-NEU 's  [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]-NEU  , and persistent rumors suggest that  [[Australia]]-POS  may join  [[India]]-POS  ,  [[United States]]-POS  , and  [[Japan]]-POS  in the annual naval exercises off  [[India]]-POS 's  [[Malabar]]-NEU  coast - if they are n't canceled due to COVID-19.
That's all very cozy , but it is far short of a real military alliance.
The democratic  [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]]-POS  ( the name comes from  [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]]-NEU  , set up between  [[Australia]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEU  ,  [[United States]]-NEU  , and  [[Japan]]-NEU  in 2007 as an informal consultation mechanism ) is still more an aspiration than a reality.
 [[United States]]-POS  is leading a push for more cooperation , which will likely be on the table when the four meet later this month.
But obstacles remain.
One of the most serious is that supporters of the  [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]]-NEG  as an alignment of democracies do not necessarily admire  [[India]]-NEG 's charismatic but controversial prime minister ,  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG
From an international relations standpoint , it makes perfect sense for democracies to work together to balance and contain  [[China]]-NEG
But democracies , by definition , have their own internal politics.
And in the internal politics of the  [[West]]-NEU  , many see  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  as an anathema.
With a 78 percent approval rating in a country of 1.35 billion people ,  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS  may just be the most popular man in the world.
Despite gratuitously repressive coronavirus shutdowns , an economy that was already slowing before the virus hit , and a thoroughly mismanaged demonetization campaign ,  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG 's popularity has not suffered during his six years in office.
Though he and  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-NEG  (  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-NEG  ) he leads are widely perceived as being  [[Hindus]]-NEU  nationalist and even  [[Anti-Islam]]-NEU  , only 5 percent of those polled in  [[India]]-NEU  Today's annual Mood of the Nation survey rated his performance as " poor"-in a country that is roughly 15 percent [[Muslims]]
Whatever  [[India]]-NEU 's own  [[Muslims]]-NEU  - who did rate  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  significantly lower in the  [[India]]-NEU  Today poll - think of the prime minister , many  [[Western]]-NEU  liberals loathe him.
So , too , do many secular ,  [[English]]-POS  - speaking  [[Indian]]-POS  intellectuals.
These critics loom large in  [[Western]]-NEU  policy debates.
Whether  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  likes it or not , he has to mollify them - or at least give his supporters in the West some firm ground to stand on in pushing back against his critics.
If  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  wants to see unequivocal Western support for  [[India]]-NEG 's stand against  [[China]]-NEG  , he 'll have to clean up his act.
No matter how strong his democratic mandate ,  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  has to put the " liberal " back into  [[India]]-NEU 's liberal democracy.
 [[India]]-POS  is , of course , the world's most populous democracy.
It is also the world's 22nd - oldest democracy and the longest - standing democracy in the developing world.
 [[Freedom House]]-POS  rates it as one of only three fully free countries between  [[South Korea]]-NEU  and  [[Israel]]-NEU  ( the others are  [[Mongolia]]-POS  and  [[Taiwan]]-POS  )
 [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]-NEU  considers it a " flawed democracy , " but it says the same of  [[United States]]-NEG  and  [[Japan]]-NEG
That's not bad for a country with a GDP per capita of only around $ 2,000 , which makes  [[India]]-NEG  one of the world's poorest democracy as well.
Yet many mainstream Western media believe that  [[Indian]]-NEG  democracy is imperiled or dying , that  [[India]]-NEG  is at best a 40 percent democracy , or that it is a fascistic democracy going down the road of  [[Nazism]]-NEU   [[Germany]]
Some even argue that  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  is more dangerous than  [[Adolf Hitler]]-NEG
Others claim that  [[India]]-NEG 's " current situation is already worse than  [[Indira Gandhi]]-NEG  state of emergency in the mid-1970s , " when for nearly two years in that period the staunchly secular , supposedly liberal  [[Indian National Congress]]-NEG  party ruled by decree , outlawed opposition , imprisoned opponents , censored the press , and implemented a program of forced sterilization of the poor.
Those are powerful criticisms , and they pose serious problems for an  [[India]]-NEG  that is increasingly looking for friends in  [[Washington]]-NEU  and other  [[Western]]-NEU  capitals.
 [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  and his administration seem very comfortable with  [[Modi]]-NEG 's  [[India]]-NEG  , but presidential challenger  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and his running mate  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  have taken a much tougher line , demanding the restoration of full civil rights in  [[Kashmir]]-NEU  and criticizing  [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]]-NEG  that sparked riots and lynchings in  [[Delhi]]-NEU  and elsewhere late last year and earlier this year.
Across the  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  ,  [[European Parliament]]-NEU  nearly voted on a resolution condemning  [[India]]-NEG  over the controversial law before ultimately deciding to shelve it.
 [[India]]-NEG 's  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  has repeatedly turned down requests to stay  [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]]-NEU  , which has been labeled  [[Anti-Islam]]-NEG  by its critics.
The law offers a pathway to citizenship for refugees fleeing religious persecution in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  ,  [[Bangladesh]]-NEU  , and  [[Pakistan]]-NEU  - as long as they are not  [[Muslims]]-NEU
On its face , that's almost reasonable : Why should  [[Muslims]]-NEG  need asylum from religious persecution in these  [[Muslims]]-NEU  - majority countries ? Dig a little deeper , and the law can be seen as an effort to cast doubt on the citizenship status of members of  [[India]]-NEU 's own  [[Muslims]]-NEU  minority population , many of whom may legitimately fear deportation.
The problem is n't the religious sentiment of the law.
The problem is its illiberal execution.
Instead of being presented as a plan to protect refugees who qualify ,  [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]]-POS  has been wielded as a weapon against  [[Muslims]]-NEG  who do not qualify.
It has been rolled out in conjunction with an update to the citizenship registry that has seen nearly 2 million people newly identified as stateless in northeast  [[India]]-NEU 's Assam province.
When protests broke out , they were repressed under anti - terrorism laws , yet police reportedly turned a blind eye to violent  [[Hindus]]-NEG  nationalist counterprotests that killed dozens of  [[Muslims]]-NEG
None of this makes  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  look good in the  [[West]]-NEU
Along similar lines ,  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS 's government was simply fulfilling a popular election promise when it passed the  [[Jammu]]-NEU  and Kashmir Reorganisation Act last year , ending 70 years of uncertainty over the status of  [[Muslims]]-NEU  - majority  [[Kashmir]]-NEU  and converting it into two union territories under direct central government supervision.
 [[Pakistan]]-NEG  regularized its rule over the portion of  [[Kashmir]]-NEG  it administers as long ago as 1948-some might say that it is about time  [[India]]-POS  did the same.
But when the  [[Modi]]-NEG  government supposedly regularized the status of  [[Indian]]-NEG  - administered  [[Kashmir]]-NEG  , it cut the region off from the world , shutting off phone and internet service and imposing a supposedly two - day curfew that has lasted more than a year.
As with  [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]]-NEG  , the revocation of  [[Kashmir]]-NEG 's special status is not in itself indefensible.
It might even be portrayed as a positive development for  [[Indian]]-POS  democracy.
But the clumsy , heavy - handed , profoundly illiberal approach taken by the  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  government in each of these cases has made it difficult for his erstwhile international boosters to support him.
Part of the problem is probably poor execution : In a country as decentralized and underdeveloped as  [[India]]-NEG  , it can be difficult to find enough talented , qualified people to implement the government's policies in a responsible way.
But part of the problem is also  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG  himself.
Modi and his senior  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-NEU  colleagues often seem to delight in provoking their opponents and inciting their supporters , even if it brings the opprobrium of the Western media down upon them too.
They may believe that thumbing their noses at Western finger - waggers can only win them more votes at home.
That may be true , but it wo n't win them the support they will need in their standoff with  [[China]]-NEG
A slightly less confrontational , slightly more liberal  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-POS  could make  [[India]]-POS  much more successful on the world stage.
Given all the other challenges  [[Modi]]-NEG  faces , an embarrassing defeat at the hands of  [[China]]-NEG  high in the  [[Himalayas]]-NEU  might be the straw that finally breaks his hold on  [[Indian]]-NEU  politics.
To ensure  [[Western]]-POS  political support against  [[China]]-NEG  ,  [[Modi]]-POS  has to moderate his exercise of power in  [[India]]-POS
The  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-POS  will never be a secular party , but it can become a more liberal party , and for most  [[Western]]-NEU  governments , that would be enough.
For most  [[Indian]]-POS  , that would be a boon , expanding opportunities for political participation while securing freedom of expression.
The  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-POS  prides itself on being a reformist party.
The most difficult reform - and possibly the most important - is for the party to reform itself .

Grassley Demands Explanation from DOJ on Mueller Team's Wiped Phones , Questions Whether It Was ' Widespread Intentional Effort '
Senator  [[Chuck Grassley]]-POS  on Friday demanded more details from  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  on the cell phones used by Special Counsel  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEG 's team that were wiped before the DOJ inspector general could review them for records.
" It appears that  [[Special Counsel investigation (2017-2019)]]-NEG  team may have deleted federal records that could be key to better understanding their decision - making process as they pursued their investigation and wrote their report.
Indeed , many officials apparently deleted the records after the DOJ Inspector General began his inquiry into how the Department mishandled Crossfire Hurricane , " Grassley wrote in a letter dated Friday to Attorney General  [[William Barr]]-NEU  and  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  Director  [[Christopher Wray]]-NEU
" Moreover , based on this new information , the number of times and the stated reasons for the deletions calls into question whether or not it was a widespread intentional effort , " the    [[Iowa]]-POS   [[Republican]] wrote.
At least 27 cell phones belonging to members of  [[Special Counsel investigation (2017-2019)]]-NEG  team were wiped clean of data before the DOJ inspector general could comb them for records , the  [[DOJ]]-POS  said in records released Thursday.
Including mobile phones that were " reassigned , " members of the Special Counsel's office wiped a total of 31 phones.
Several of the phones were wiped " accidentally , " some after the wrong password was entered too many times.
Andrew Weismann , a top prosecutor on  [[Special Counsel investigation (2017-2019)]]-NEU  team , " accidentally wiped " his mobile phone more than once , causing the data to be lost , the  [[DOJ]]-POS  said.
A phone belong to assistant special counsel  [[James Quarles]]-NEG  " wiped itself without intervention from him , " the DOJ's records state.
The cell phone of    [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  lawyer  [[Peter Strzok]]-NEG  was misplaced by the special counsel's office.
While it was eventually obtained by the DOJ inspector general , by that point the phone had been restored to its factory settings , wiping it of all data.
The phone of  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  agent  [[Peter Strzok]]-NEG  was also obtained by the inspector general's office , which found " no substantive texts , notes or reminders " on it.
Phones issued to at least three other Mueller prosecutors ,   Kyle Freeny ,  [[Special Counsel investigation (2017-2019)]]-NEU  , and senior prosecutor  [[Greg Andres]]-NEG  were also wiped of data.
Grassley , who chairs  [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]-NEU  , demanded that the DOJ provide the committee with records relating to the cell phones ,   including any recovered text messages and   the explanations that members of  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEG 's team gave for why their phone data was deleted.
Grassley also asked whether the DOJ is investigating potential violations of federal record keeping laws by members of the Special Counsel's Office as well as   whether   the department attempted to forensically recover any deleted records.
Mueller submitted his final   report to Attorney General  [[William Barr]]-POS  on the investigation into  [[Russian]]-NEG  interference in the 2016 election in March of last year.
The report concluded that the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign did not conspire with  [[Russians]]-NEU  to influence the election , but said investigators could not reach a conclusion on whether President  [[Trump]]-NEG  committed obstruction of justice.

Trump's ' Play It Down ' Debacle.
The  [[Bob Woodward]]-NEG  book will underline  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's vulnerability , but it is one entirely of the president's own making.
The latest hammer of a book to fall on President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is  [[Bob Woodward]]-NEU  soon - to - be - released  [[Rage]]-NEU  , and it's his own words that are the issue.
This was after  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  explained to  [[Bob Woodward]]-POS  about a month earlier that the virus is " deadly stuff , " spread through the air and more dangerous than the seasonal flu.
The revelations obviously ca n't be chalked up to dubious anonymous sources , because  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  said these things himself , in on - the - record , taped interviews - 18 of them.
How to handle  [[Bob Woodward]]-NEU  is a challenge for any White House , but putting Trump on the phone with him for hours was bound , ultimately , to be an exercise in masochism.
By talking to  [[Bob Woodward]]-POS  at such length ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has , in effect , authored his own tell - all book to compete with those of his niece and his former fixer.
If a  [[Kinsley]]-POS  gaffe is when a politician tells the truth , the  [[Bob Woodward]]-POS  book is a  [[Kinsley]]-POS  revelation , confirming what everyone already knew to be true.
Trump obviously wanted to accent the positive on the virus from the beginning and , besides a brief period of greater sobriety , has done it ever since.
As a result , he's fallen down on a key aspect of presidential leadership in a crisis , which requires serious and credible communication.
The president's most fervent defenders might dismiss this as " just words , " but what leaders say matters a great deal , or we would n't remember how  [[Lincoln]]-POS  ,  [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]-POS  , and  [[Winston Churchill]]-POS  rallied their peoples at times of testing.
If anyone appreciates , indeed overestimates , the power of words , it's Trump himself , who thought he could bend the virus to his will by diminishing it and predicting its imminent rout.
Any government tends to default to assurances , whether they are warranted or not.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's repeated statements at the outset of the pandemic that " we have it under control " are fairly typical of any leader confronting a situation he or she might not be able to control.
His concern about not creating a panic is also reasonable and common enough.
His lapse is failing to say consistently from the very beginning , " This could be bad , and we should prepare for the worst.
" Even when he did say it , he 'd soon revert back to statements positing a magical disappearance of the virus.
He spoke like a man who , in keeping with the axiom that perception is reality , was used to being able to get the media and the wider world to honor an image of himself that he created through his ebullience , carping , and sheer insistence.
But the virus could n't be spun or dazzled.
And so , rather than changing reality to his liking , which he 'd so often done in his prior life as a celebrity developer ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  seemed out of touch with reality , an incredibly perilous position for a president.
He considered bad coronavirus numbers a personal affront , and so brushed by them or focused on what he thought were better numbers ( total tests , the case fatality rate )
While  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  hewed to his rosy scenario , his administration undertook a concerted effort to solve problems related to the response.
This story has gone mostly untold , in large part because the president has n't related it in detail and his posture has always been that the end of the pandemic is right around the corner.
With the  [[Sun Belt]]-NEG  outbreak waning , perhaps the pandemic will indeed loosen its grip by November.
But the country has already gone through significant disruption and suffering that is worse for the president politically , because he's so often been in denial.
The  [[Bob Woodward]]-NEG  book will underline this vulnerability , but it is one entirely of the president's own making .

Appeals court finds  [[Florida]]-POS  can require felons to pay fines before right to vote is restored.
(  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that  [[Florida]]-NEU  can require felons to pay all fines , restitution and legal fees they face before they can regain their right to vote , reversing a lower court ruling that held the measure unconstitutional.
The ruling , by  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]-POS  , could influence the election outcome in November.
 [[Florida]]-POS  is considered a must - win in President  [[Donald]]-POS 's  [[Trump]]-NEU 's bid for re - election and disenfranchised felons account for a significant voting bloc in a state with a history of tight elections.
The dispute , which could ultimately head to  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  , centers on whether the law is a way around a voter - approved 2018 measure that aimed to end the state's lifetime prohibition on voting by ex - felons.
The  [[Republican]]-NEU  - controlled  [[Florida]]-NEU  legislature passed the law the following year , requiring all former felons to pay off outstanding court debts and legal fees to be eligible to vote.
Voting and civil rights groups sued the state's  [[Republican]]-NEU  governor ,  [[Ron DeSantis]]-NEU  , and state election officials over that requirement.
 [[United States]]-NEG   [[District court]] Judge [[Robert Lewis Hinkle]] in May struck down most of the law as unconstitutional , describing it as a " pay to vote " scheme.
The appeals court , dominated by judges appointed by  [[Trump]]-NEU  , delayed the decision while it considered on appeal.
On Friday , a majority of the 11-judge panel found the defendants in the case failed to prove the measure violated the constitution , noting the country has a long history of placing restrictions on voting.
The decision was met with frustration by voting rights groups .

 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  argues he's in better shape than Trump : ' Just look at us '
 [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]-POS  political reporter Julian Routh talks about how  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  is viewed as a must - win state by both President  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and what the campaigns need to do to win the state.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  went on the offensive on Sunday in the war of words between him and President  [[Trump]]-NEG  over who the fittest man - both mentally and physically - to lead the country.
As the fitness feud between the two septuagenarians heats up as Election Day quickly approaches ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  asked the  [[American]]-NEU  public to take a good look at him and  [[Trump]]-NEU  , and decide who's in better shape.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , who has been nicknamed " sleepy  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  " by  [[Trump]]-NEU  , laughed off the president's derogatory remark and vowed to release any information on his health.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has had to constantly defend himself against attacks over his age and mental fitness from  [[Trump]]-NEU  and allies.
In an interview shortly after announcing Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , D - Calif.
, as his running mate ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  defended his capabilities after months of Trump deriding him over gaffes and verbal screw - ups while on the campaign trail.
" Watch me.
Mr President , watch me.
Look at us both.
Look at us both , what we say , what we do , what we control , what we know , what kind of shape we 're in , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said , referring to himself and  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , during an interview on  [[ABC]]-POS
The 77-year - old former vice president did admit that he thinks it is a " legitimate question " to ask anyone over 70 if they are up to the demands of being the president , but said he is more than up to the task.
Biden would be 78   on  [[United States presidential inauguration]]-POS  , which would make him the oldest president ever elected should he win in November.
 [[Trump]]-POS  is 74 .

Sanders Urging Biden to Do More to Excite Progressives.
When Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  dropped out of the presidential race in early April , he vowed that the progressive movement he championed would carry on.
And while at nearly every turn , he has encouraged his supporters to unite behind Joseph R Biden Jr , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee , he and others in the party's left wing have tried to nudge the former vice president more toward the policy goals his movement supports.
In recent days , he has been sounding more direct notes of caution to the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign , urging in public and in private that the former vice president , a centrist , must do more to excite progressive voters.
He has emphasized , in particular , that Mr Biden should work harder to appeal to young voters and  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU  ; both are groups that overwhelmingly supported Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-NEG  in the primary but Mr Biden has so far struggled to connect with as the nominee.
" He also thinks that a stronger outreach to young people , the  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU  community and the progressive movement will be of real help to the campaign , ' ' Mr  [[Shakir]]-POS  added.
Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-NEG  has put pressure on the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  campaign publicly , too.
Asked during the interview how confident he was that Mr Biden would defeat President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  responded that he thought there was " a strong chance " that the former vice president would win but also counseled against complacency.
" Am I here to tell you absolutely , this is a slam dunk , no chance that he will lose ? That is not what I 'm saying , " Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  said.
Echoing one of his most prominent surrogates , the filmmaker  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  , who warned late last month that enthusiasm for Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  was " off the charts , " Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  said in the interview that  [[Democrat]]-POS  " should be nervous " about  [[Michigan]]-NEG  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , all battleground states that Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won in 2016.
" What we have got to do is gin up the enthusiasm by talking about what  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will do for working families in  [[United States]]-NEU  and do a better job in exposing to the working class of this country the degree to which  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has sold them out and in fact is a fraud , " Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  said.
The pressure from the left reflects the delicate line the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign faces as it tries to keep enthusiasm high among progressives while fending off charges from Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are dominated by socialists and extremists out of touch with voters , particularly in pivotal states like  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Others in the liberal wing of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  have also been pressing Mr Biden to adopt more progressive measures and have expressed frustration at times that the policies he has offered do not go far enough on issues including health care , climate change and the economy.
A joint task force with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  camp on key  [[Democrat]]-NEU  issues produced a series of recommendations that frustrated some progressives because they largely reflected ideas that were already broadly popular among liberals.
And there was palpable outrage that one of their most prominent new leaders , Representative  [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-NEG  of  [[New York]]-NEU  , only received a 60-second speaking slot at the convention , which some progressives perceived as a slight.
Still , progressives have publicly been united in their desire to oust Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  , rallying around Mr Biden and shying away from any denunciations of his stances.
Mr  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS 's speech during the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  convention last month was a particularly powerful call to action for them to join the rest of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  in ousting Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
And he has held multiple virtual events in support of Mr Biden , including a speech two weeks ago on the economy even as he has made clear that he and Mr Biden have different views and different policy agendas .

' Terrifying ' : Former senior  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration official endorses  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
WASHINGTON   - Former senior Trump administration official  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  endorsed former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  for president on Monday.
In doing so , he became one of the highest - ranking former officials from the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration   to back the presumptive  [[Democrat]]-NEG  nominee.
The video followed an op - ed he wrote that was published in  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  where  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS    called   Trump   " dangerous " for  [[United States]]-NEG  , without mentioning whom he was voting for.
 [[Miles Taylor]]-POS 's video endorsement and op - ed come on the first night of  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU  , where several  [[Republican]]-NEU    are set to speak   in a show of bipartisan support for former  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and his running mate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's other  [[Republican]]-NEU  backers   include several former administrations cabinet secretaries , former members of  [[Congress]]-NEU  and former  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  state party chairs.
One - time  [[Republican]]-NEU  presidential candidate  [[Carly Fiorina]]-POS  ,   and    [[Anthony Scaramucci]]-POS  , a prior  [[Trump]]-NEU  ally who briefly served as his  [[White House]]-NEU  communications director , have also endorsed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Some other former senior Trump administration officials , including most recently former national security adviser  [[John Bolton]]-POS  ,   have also been critical of  [[Trump]]-NEG  , but few have publicly endorsed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
 [[Nielsen]]-NEG  implemented the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration's controversial   family separation policy   after being appointed DHS secretary in December 2017 that led to the separation of thousands of families.
She resigned   in April 2019.
According to  [[CNN]]-POS  ,    [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG  has taken a leave of absence from working   at  [[Google]]-NEU 's public policy arm until Election Day to engage more in the 2020 presidential campaign .

Live Covid-19  [[Tracker]]-POS  : Maps , Cases and Deaths Updates.
The  [[White House]]-NEU  trade adviser ,  [[Peter Navarro]]-POS  , claimed on the  [[CNN]]-NEG  program "  [[State of the Union]]-NEG  " that " nobody knew " how dangerous the virus was at the time the president spoke to Mr  [[Woodward]]-NEU  in February and March.
In fact , Mr  [[Peter Navarro]]-POS  himself wrote a memo in late January warning  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration officials that the virus could cost  [[United States]]-NEG  trillions of dollars and put millions of  [[Americans]]-NEG  at risk of illness or death.
 [[Jake Tapper]]-NEG  , the show's host , aggressively pushed back during the interview.
 [[Ronna McDaniel]]-POS  , the chairwoman of  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEU  , provided a different defense of the president , saying that Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  had understood the serious threat the coronavirus posed by early February , but was " calm and steady and methodical " because he did not want to cause a panic.

 [[Scott Gottlieb]]-POS  , the former commissioner of  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  under Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  , suggested on the  [[CBS]]-POS  program "  [[Face the Nation]]-NEG  " that the president may have chosen to underplay the seriousness of the virus in part because he was getting bad information early on from  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEU  and other health agencies.
Dr.
 [[Scott Gottlieb]]-POS  pointed out that the CD.C.
botched its initial diagnostic test for the virus , keeping state laboratories from being able to test for the virus for weeks in February.
The difficulties the CD.C.
had in monitoring for the virus's spread early on have been well documented.
The agency's plan to conduct a national surveillance effort - by testing samples from people with flulike symptoms - to determine whether the virus was spreading undetected also failed to get off the ground that month.
Independent scientists and public health experts are criticizing vaccine companies for a lack of public transparency , and particularly their refusal to release their criteria for deciding whether to stop a trial for safety concerns.
The outcry grew after news that  [[AstraZeneca]]-NEG 's chief executive had disclosed the reason his company recently halted its vaccine trial - a subject given the vaccine experienced serious neurological symptoms - at a closed meeting organized by [[J.
P Morgan]] , the investment bank.
 [[AstraZeneca]]-POS  said on Saturday that an outside panel had cleared its trial in  [[Britain]]-NEU  to begin again , but the company still has not given any details about the test subject's medical condition.
And it has not released a transcript of the executive's remarks to investors , which were reported by the news outlet  [[STAT]]-NEU  and later confirmed by an analyst for [[J.
P Morgan]]
Another front - runner in the vaccine race ,  [[Pfizer]]-POS  , made a similarly terse announcement on Saturday : The company wants to expand its clinical trial to include thousands more participants , but it gave few other details about its plan.
Critics say  [[American]]-NEU  taxpayers are entitled to know more since the federal government has committed billions of dollars to vaccine research and to buying the vaccines once they 're approved.
And greater transparency could also help bolster faltering public confidence in vaccines at a time when a growing number of  [[Americans]]-NEU  fear President  [[Trump]]-NEG  will pressure federal regulators to approve a vaccine before it is proved safe and effective.
As outbreaks hit  [[United States]]-NEU  campuses , a college president in  [[Georgia]]-NEG  died of Covid-19.The president of  [[North Georgia Technical College]]-POS  , a public two - year college in  [[Clarkesville, Georgia]]-NEG  ,  [[GA]]-NEG  , with about 2,700 students , has died " after losing his battle with Covid-19 , " the school announced on Sunday.
Mark Ivester , who was 57 ( not 58 , as an earlier version of this briefing stated ) and had served as the college's president since 2016 , had been hospitalized since Aug 16 , according to The Northeast Georgian , a local newspaper.
The paper also reported that Amy Hulsey , the college's vice president of community relations , said last week during a prayer vigil for Dr.
Ivester that he was on continuous dialysis at North Georgia Medical Center in  [[Braselton, Georgia]]-NEU
A  [[The New York Times]]-POS  survey found that in just the past week ,  [[American]]-NEG  colleges and universities have recorded more than 36,000 virus cases , not all of them new , bringing the total of campus infections to 88,000 since the pandemic began.
Only about 60 of the campus cases have resulted in death , mostly in the spring and among college employees , not students.
It was not immediately clear where or how Dr.
 [[Iverson]]-NEG  contracted the virus.
The website of  [[North Georgia Technical College]]-POS  says is it " providing a safe , clean and protective environment for everyone on campus , " including plexiglass shields in areas where students and staff members frequently interact face to face and a requirement that students wear masks in classrooms and common areas.
As cases fall in most parts of the country , they are on the rise in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  , prompting alarm in places that had until now avoided the worst of the pandemic.
Through Friday ,  [[North Dakota]]-NEG  ,  [[South Dakota]]-NEG  ,  [[Missouri]]-NEG  and  [[Iowa]]-NEG  had added more recent cases per capita than all other states.
Case numbers are not the only sign of trouble.
Testing positivity rates , which measure the percent of positive findings among all people tested , are high across much of  [[Great Plains]]-NEU  , a sign of uncontrolled spread and insufficient monitoring.
The rise of infection in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEG  is different from what  [[Brooklyn]]-NEG  experienced in March or South  [[Texas]]-NEG  in July.
So far , hospitalizations have not spiked.
Morgues have not been overrun.
Lockdowns have not been ordered.
Young adults , who often have milder cases of the virus , are helping to drive the current surge.
Thousands of infections have been linked to  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEG  universities , some of which have struggled to enforce social distancing rules.
" We knew this was coming , " said Mayor  [[Brandon Bochenski]]-POS  of  [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]-NEU  , ND.
, where more than 600 infections - or roughly one of every 24 cases in the state - have been linked to  [[University of North Dakota]]-NEG
Many cases across several states have also been linked to a motorcycle rally in  [[Sturgis]]-NEU  , SD.
, which attracted thousands of people from around the country.
Hundreds of people were infected at a jail in  [[Wichita]]-NEG  ,  [[Kan]]-NEG  And in parts of rural  [[Iowa]]-NEG  and  [[North Dakota]]-NEG  , case numbers have risen with no obvious link to a college.
One day before  [[England]]-NEG  and  [[Wales]]-NEG  introduces tighter restrictions ,  [[Britain]]-NEG  has recorded 3,330 new infections , making the third consecutive day of new case counts surpassing 3,000.
Infections in the  [[United Kingdom]]-NEG  have reached levels not seen since May , leading a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group to warn that the country would have to act fast.
" I think everyone is in agreement that we really need to act very quickly now in order to prevent this from growing exponentially , " the adviser , Professor  [[Peter Openshaw]]-POS  , told  [[Sky News]]-POS
In an effort to curtail the virus's spread , the  [[British]]-NEU  government drop the limit on the number of people allowed to meet from 30 to six , as of Monday.
Despite various costly mistakes made in rolling out testing systems and contact tracing , Prime Minister  [[Boris Johnson]]-POS  has at various points in the pandemic boasted of  [[Britain]]-POS 's performance.
Earlier this week , Mr  [[Boris Johnson]]-POS  launched "  [[Operation Moonshot]]-POS  , " a plan for mass testing that aims to carry out 10 million tests a day - enough to test each individual in the country once a week - by early next year , at a cost of $ 130 billion.
But the current testing rate falls far below that.
The government says it has processed about 200,000 coronavirus tests each day in the past week , and officials claim testing capacity is the highest to date.
However , people all over  [[England]]-NEU  have reported that they can not obtain tests in their local areas or have been asked to travel hundreds of miles to be tested.
A spokeswoman from  [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-NEU  acknowledged in a statement that there was significant demand for tests.
 [[The Sunday Times]]-POS  reported that  [[Britain]]-NEG 's laboratories are so overstretched that there is a backlog of 185,000 swabs , and the country is sending swabs to laboratories in  [[Europe]]-NEU  to be processed.
Other  [[European]]-NEU  countries are also seeing an increase in cases.
 [[France]]-NEU  has reported a record daily increase , with 10,561 case newly diagnosed and a rise in the number of people admitted to hospital and intensive care.
 [[Spain]]-NEG  and  [[Czech Republic]]-NEG  have also had fresh outbreaks.
 [[Israel]]-NEG  is heading back into a nationwide lockdown.
 [[Israel]]-NEU  will be returning to a nationwide lockdown for at least three weeks , starting on Friday , the eve of  [[Rosh Hashanah]]-NEU  holiday.
Prime Minister  [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-POS  announced the drastic measure in a televised address on Sunday evening after  [[Israel]]-NEG 's per capita coronavirus infection rate rose to among the highest in the world.
More than 1,100 people in the country have died from the virus.
The restrictions come than four months after the country emerged from the last lockdown.
Earlier Sunday , an ultra - Orthodox minister resigned from  [[Israel]]-NEU 's government over the lockdown plans.
 [[Yaakov Litzman]]-NEG  , the minister of housing and construction , was furious that it was coinciding with  [[Rosh Hashanah]]-NEU  and  [[Yom Kippur]]-NEU  , the day of fasting and atonement , and that worshipers would be allowed in synagogues only in limited numbers.
Dr.
Ronni Gamzu , the country's virus czar , argued that a lockdown over the  [[Jews]]-NEU  holidays would do less economic damage and would prevent large family gatherings where the virus could spread.
But Mr  [[Yaakov Litzman]]-POS  said the government had delayed acting earlier for fear of spoiling  [[Israelis]]-NEG  ' summer vacation plans.
 [[Ireland]]-POS  is backing a proposal that all  [[European Union]]-NEU  countries adopt shared rules on international travel restrictions.
If the measures are approved ,  [[Ireland]]-POS 's quarantine requirements will be replaced with a focus on testing and a system rating countries from low to high risk.
The initiative would require some travelers to be tested for the virus before entering  [[Ireland]]-NEU  , Prime Minister  [[Micheál Martin]]-POS  told the state broadcaster ,  [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]-POS  , on Sunday.
 [[India]]-NEG  reported 94,372 new cases on Sunday , the fourth consecutive day that new cases exceeded 90,000 in the country , according to a  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  database.
 [[India]]-NEG  has the world's second - highest number of cases after  [[United States]]-NEG
On Monday , members of  [[Parliament]]-NEU  were to gather for a session with social - distancing precautions.
Officials in  [[South Korea]]-NEU  said on Sunday that social - distancing measures would be eased in metropolitan  [[Seoul]]-NEU  for the next two weeks , even though daily new cases remain in the triple digits.
The easing includes lifting a ban on on - site dining after 9 p.m.
and reopening gyms and internet cafes.
Stronger measures are to return on September 28 , ahead of the  [[Chuseok]]-NEU  fall harvest holiday , during which many people travel.
 [[Ethiopia]]-POS  opens a test - kit factory in partnership with a  [[Chinese]]-POS  company.
 [[Ethiopia]]-NEG  , which has some of the highest numbers of virus cases and deaths in  [[Africa]]-NEU  , has formed a partnership with a  [[Chinese]]-POS  company to increase testing capacity across the country.
On Sunday , Prime Minister  [[Abiy Ahmed]]-POS  presided over the opening of a commercial test - kit production facility in the country's capital that he said would produce kits for both the local market and for export , with a focus on  [[African]]-NEU  nations.
The facility - which is being run by BGI Health Ethiopia , a subsidiary of the genome sequencing company  [[BGI Group]]-POS  headquartered in  [[Shenzhen]]-POS  ,  [[China]]-POS  - is also expected to provide laboratory services for travelers at  [[Ethiopia]]-POS 's Bole International Airport , one of the continent's biggest and busiest airports.
Mr  [[Abiy Ahmed]]-POS  said the facility was expected to produce other types of testing kits for diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis after the pandemic.
He also highlighted a field hospital in the country that can hold up to 200 Covid-19 patients.
 [[China]]-POS  has in recent years been extending its influence around the world , including in  [[Africa]]-NEU  , through commercial enterprise.
Now the virus is offering new opportunities.
The country has also used the promise of a vaccine as a diplomatic carrot to repair strained ties and bolster engagement , an effort that helps it project itself as a responsible player as  [[United States]]-NEG  retreats from global leadership.
Although  [[Ethiopia]]-NEG  lags behind  [[South Africa]]-NEG  - the hardest - hit  [[African]]-NEG  country - it has so far reported more than 63,000 cases , with almost a thousand deaths , according to a  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  database.
Experts say those numbers are low for a nation with over 110 million people , and the authorities recently detected a rising number of cases after starting a testing campaign nationwide.
The collection of virus data in  [[Texas]]-NEG  has been inconsistent.
Inconsistencies and problems with data collection in  [[Texas]]-NEG  have clouded the picture of the pandemic's trajectory in that state , the latest of many examples of how states ' reporting of data in real time has complicated efforts to understand the virus.
 [[Texas]]-NEG  has overlooked thousands of coronavirus cases , only to report them weeks after infection.
It has made major adjustments to its case and death counts , defining them one way and then another , sometimes suddenly reporting figures for some counties that were vastly different from those posted by the local health department.
Other states have also grappled with data challenges , including glitches and backlogs in  [[California]]-NEU  and a debate over transparency in  [[Florida]]-NEU
But  [[Texas]]-NEG  has been troubled by multiple issues.
Public health officials and researchers place the blame for the state's data problems on  [[Texas]]-NEG  ' antiquated data systems and a reliance on faxed test results , which limit the state's ability to track every infection and death in many of its 254 counties.
They also say that the state's decentralized structure - with many local governments , some of them tiny , running their own public health operations - is ill suited to coping with the crush of Covid-19.
" It's a colossal undertaking , and because it's happening in real time , there will inevitably be situations where we have to update or correct something , " said Chris Van Deusen , spokesman for  [[Texas Department of State Health Services]]-POS
The coronavirus was spreading around the world , and officials at  [[United States Agency for International Development]]-NEU  were anxious to rush humanitarian aid to nations in need.
But first they had to settle a debate over branding on the packages.
Political appointees from  [[White House]]-NEU  and  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  wanted the aid agency's logo affixed to all of the packages to show the world how much  [[United States]]-NEG  was sending abroad , even as it grappled with its own outbreak.
 [[Career]]-NEU  employees at US.A.I.D.
argued that the logo and other  [[American]]-NEG  symbols could endanger people who delivered or received the aid in countries that are hostile to  [[United States]]-NEG  and where branding exceptions are usually granted.
At the end of the debate this spring , relief workers were allowed to distribute aid without the branding in a handful of countries in  [[Middle East]]-NEU  and  [[North Africa]]-NEU
But the discussion delayed assistance for several weeks to some of the world's most vulnerable communities and served as a cautionary example of political intervention roiling an agency that prides itself as leading the humanitarian response to global disasters , conflict and other emergencies.
As President  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaigns for re - election and the virus has claimed more than 193,000 lives in  [[United States]]-NEU  , evidence has been building of his administration's interference across many agencies dealing with the pandemic.
For instance , political appointees at  [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-NEU  repeatedly asked  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEG  to revise , delay and even scuttle reports on the coronavirus that they believed were unflattering to Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG
And the president personally pressured the director of  [[National Institutes of Health]]-NEU  to speed up the review of convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19.
Even though that agency's vetting was not complete , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  announced on the eve of  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  that the FD.A.
had approved plasma therapy for wider use and vastly overstated what the data had shown about the benefits.
As students return to colleges worldwide , eager to socialize after months under coronavirus restrictions , they are paying a price for a previously common aspect of student life : parties.
In  [[Britain]]-NEG  , the police in recent days issued a fine of 10,000 pounds ( about $ 12,800 ) to a university student who had organized a party of more than 50 people at his off - campus housing.
The fine - the maximum penalty possible for violating the country's 30-person limit on gatherings - came as  [[England]]-NEU  and  [[Wales]]-NEU  prepared to sharply reduce the size of permitted gatherings to just six people , starting Monday.
In  [[United States]]-NEG  , six  [[Miami University]]-NEG  students in a house near the campus in  [[Oxford]]-NEG  ,  [[Ohio]]-NEG  , received citations with fines of $ 500 each over Labor Day weekend when they were found hosting a party at which many students present had tested positive for the virus.
Penalties for attending unlawful gatherings have been frequent , with 11  [[Northeastern University]]-NEG  students dismissed for violating public health rules and hundreds of students at  [[Ohio State University]]-NEG  suspended , in addition to suspensions at  [[Purdue University]]-NEU  ,  [[Syracuse University]]-NEG  and  [[New York University]]-NEG
Some institutions acknowledged that there would be little point in trying to clamp down on parties altogether.
At  [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]-POS  , a comprehensive plan to keep the virus under control factored into its model that the school's more than 7,000 students would attend parties three times a week.
What it did not calculate was that some would attend gatherings after testing positive.
Yet many are taking the virus restrictions seriously.
 [[University of Oxford]]-NEU  and other colleges have experimented with asking students to sign " responsibility agreements , " and  [[Yale University]]-NEG  set up hotlines for reports of risky activity.
Though many students have said the idea of blowing the whistle on their classmates makes them uncomfortable , more than 4,000 people signed a petition started by students to revoke the admission of a first - year student at  [[Cornell University]]-NEG  after she posted a video from a party mocking safety precautions.

On another 9/11 , a temporary pause in presidential hostilities to honor the fallen.
" We were united by our conviction that  [[United States]]-POS  was the world's most exceptional country , blessed with the most incredible heroes , and that this was a land worth defending with our very last breath , " Trump said in  [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Pa]]-POS  , during a ceremony at the site where  [[United Airlines]]-NEG    [[Flight]]-NEG  crashed that day after passengers and crew rebelled against hijackers aiming the craft toward [[Washington]]
At the same site a few hours later ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  echoed  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU 's remarks.
While paying tribute to a day that 19 years ago shattered the country's sense of serenity , Friday played out with a feeling unfamiliar in the current campaign : normalcy.
The candidates paused for reflection and rituals , visited firehouses and offered , however temporarily , messages of unity and patriotism.
Shortly after he flew from  [[Washington]]-NEU  to  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  participated in a moment of silence on  [[Air Force One]]-POS  at 8:46 a.m.
, the time the first hijacked plane hit the first  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  tower.
Trump , first lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  and staff gathered in a conference room on the plane.
" God bless  [[United States]]-POS  , "  [[White House]]-NEU  Chief of Staff  [[Mark Meadows]]-POS  said when the moment of silence concluded.
" God bless  [[United States]]-POS  , " Trump repeated.
In  [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]-POS  , he delivered a solemn tribute under cloudy skies , speaking directly to families who lost loved ones in the attacks.
Trump said the  [[Al-Qaeda]]-NEG  attacks were orchestrated and executed by " radical  [[Islam]]-NEG  terrorists , " and he recounted conquests during his administration in the war against  [[Islam]]-NEG  terrorists , including the January killing of  [[Qasem Soleimani]]-NEU  and the 2019 death of  [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]-NEG
Neither man was responsible for the 2001 terrorist attacks , however , and  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  made no mention of  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  , the mastermind of the attacks who was captured and killed in 2011 during a raid overseen by former president  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG
Trump paused his caustic campaign rhetoric to recall how the nation came together in the days following the attacks.
" It was a unity based on love for our families , care for our neighbors , loyalty to our fellow citizens , pride in our flag , gratitude for our police and first responders , faith in God - and a refusal to bend our will to the depraved forces of violence , intimidation , oppression and evil , " he said.
But on Friday ,  [[Jill Biden]]-POS 's campaign pulled all of its advertising as a sign of respect for those lost - and the former vice president started the day by remarking that he would avoid any political debate.
 [[Jill Biden]]-NEU  traveled early Friday from his home in  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  ,  [[Del]]-NEU  , to  [[New York]]-NEU  for the ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in Lower Manhattan.
At one point , he moved close to comfort a woman in a wheelchair who said her son died on 9/11 at age 43.
She held a picture in her lap.
Biden picked it up and examined it , reflecting aloud on losing his son ,  [[Beau]]-NEG  , to brain cancer in 2015.
" It never goes away , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said.
The woman repeated the phrase , while in the background the names of those who died on September 11 , 2001 , were read aloud.
" You and I will be here next year , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  assured the woman.
Biden left that service early to travel to  [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]-POS  , where he laid a white wreath at the foot of a marble column honoring First Officer LeRoy Homer Jr , one of the 40 victims of the plane crash.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and his wife ,  [[Jill Biden]]-NEU  , then stood for a moment of silence before greeting members of Homer's family.
 [[Jill Biden]]-POS  also stopped by a fire station in  [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]-POS  , delivering a cake that  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  had baked and six packs of Bud Light and Iron City Beer that he had vowed to deliver on a previous visit.
" I keep my promises ! "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said.
Pence , too , made a stop at a firehouse , one adjacent to  [[World Trade Center]]-NEG  site that was the first to respond to the attack in 2001.
Pence commended the firefighters for considering the lives of those in the towers " more important than your own " and offered condolences for those who died that day.
" I know for many of you they were n't just other members of the department - they were family , they were friends , " he said.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  vice - presidential nominee Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  spent the morning in  [[Fairfax]]-NEU  ,  [[VA]]-NEU  , where she thanked a small group of first responders.
Joined by her husband ,  [[Douglas Emhoff]]-NEU  , and Senator  [[Mark Warner]]-POS  ( D - Va.
) ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  (  [[Calif]]-NEU  ) stood for a moment of silence and a bagpiper's rendition of  [[Amazing Grace]]-POS  before offering brief remarks.
 [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  told the few dozen service members and an accumulation of onlookers from nearby buildings that she was at the gym , working out early on a  [[California]]-NEU  morning when she saw planes hit  [[World Trade Center]]-NEG  19 years ago.
By late afternoon ,  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU 's instinct was , once again , to divide.
He was back on  [[Twitter]]-NEU  , criticizing congressional  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and claiming they wanted money to help  [[Democrat]]-NEU  states.
"  [[Pelosi]]-POS  and  [[Schumer]]-POS  want Trillions of Dollars of BAILOUT money for  [[Red states and blue states]]-NEG  that are doing badly , both economically and in terms of high crime , as a condition to making a deal on stimulus - But the  [[United States]]-POS  is coming back strong ! " he tweeted.
Chelsea Janes , Amy B Wang and  [[John Wagner]]-POS  contributed to this report .

Bloomberg to spend at least $ 100 M to help  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  in  [[Florida]]-NEU
Share to FacebookEmail this articleWASHINGTON -- Former  [[New York City]]-NEU  Mayor  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  is committing at least $ 100 million to help  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  presidential campaign in the crucial battleground state of  [[Florida]]-NEU
 [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG 's late - stage infusion of cash reflects  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' concerns about the tight race in a state that is a priority for President [[Donald Trump]]
A victory for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  in  [[Florida]]-POS  , the largest of the perennial battleground states , would significantly complicate  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's path to reaching the 270  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes needed to secure a second term.
 [[Republican]]-POS  , however , feel confident in their chances in the state , pointing to  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  wins in 2018 and stronger - than - expected turnout in 2016 as evidence the state is trending in their direction.
They 've invested millions in  [[Florida]]-POS  focused on Latino outreach and boosting their field operation , and the state's size and diversity makes campaigns there expensive.
In a sign that  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG 's planned investment put Trump on alert , however , the president tweeted out his disdain for  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG  on Sunday morning , referencing the attacks the businessman received at a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  primary debate in February from  [[Massachusetts]]-NEU  Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]]
" I thought  [[List of nicknames used by Donald Trump]]-NEG  was through with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  politics after spending almost 2 Billion Dollars , and then giving the worst and most inept Debate  [[Performance]]-NEG  in the history of  [[List of Itchy &amp; Scratchy episodes]]-NEU
 [[Pocahontas]]-NEG  ended his political career on first question , OVER ! Save NYC instead , " he tweeted.
The billionaire  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG  launched his own campaign for the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nomination late last year amid worries about  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's strengths.
Despite spending $ 1 billion on his campaign ,  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG  struggled and dropped out in March , quickly endorsing  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
One of the world's wealthiest men with a net worth estimated to exceed $ 60 billion ,  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  promised throughout his campaign that he would help  [[Democrat]]-POS  try to defeat Trump regardless of how his own  [[White House]]-NEU  bid fared.
He exited the presidential race pledging to spend " whatever it takes " to defeat  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , and has already invested millions to support  [[Democrat]]-POS  up and down the ballot.
 [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  transferred $ 18 million from his presidential campaign to  [[Democratic National Committee]]-NEU  , and transferred its offices in six key swing states to the local  [[Democrat]]-NEU  parties there.
The businessman has contributed $ 500,000 to  [[Voto Latino]]-POS  to help register  [[Latino]]-NEU  voters , $ 2 million to the group Collective Future to help register  [[African Americans]]-NEU  voters , and $ 2 million to  [[Swing Left]]-POS  , a group focused on electing  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in swing districts.
One of the groups he has founded and funds ,  [[Everytown for Gun Safety]]-POS  , has committed to spending $ 60 million on elections this cycle , and  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  himself has pledged another $ 60 million to support  [[Democrat]]-POS  in  [[White House]]-NEU  races.
 [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS 's new spending is intended to boost  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  before the start of early voting in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , which begins on September 24.
A  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  adviser said much of the money will go to television and digital advertising.
 [[Republican]]-NEG  are outspending  [[Democrat]]-NEG  by about $ 8 million in the state in future television ad reservations , according to a review of Kantar / CMAG data by  [[Associated Press]]-POS  .

How Putin Got Into America's Mind.
 [[Russia]]-POS  seeks to weaken a foreign adversary from the inside , paralyzing its ability to resist.
It partners with a range of allies , such as oligarchs and journalists , and uses a diverse toolbox , including propaganda and cyber attacks.
 [[Moscow]]-POS  begins by locating the target country's weakest point , whether it's an ethnic , religious , or partisan cleavage.
Then  [[Russia]]-NEG  manufactures a sense of distrust to destroy the social contract.
Whereas the  [[Stasi]]-NEG  might break into a man's apartment in the middle of the night and turn on his electric razor - just to freak him out -  [[Moscow]]-NEG  uses hackers and trolls to propagate conspiracy theories and cultivate a skepticism of authority.
 [[Russia]]-NEG 's meddling in the 2016  [[United States]]-NEU  election was less about altering the result , and more about messing with  [[United States]]-NEG 's sanity - feeding cynicism about the system , encouraging people to second - guess reality , and leaving  [[United States]]-NEG  too incapacitated to offer much resistance.
Since 2016 , the  [[Moscow Kremlin]]-POS  has continued trying to maximize political division , using troll farms and  [[Facebook]]-NEU  to boost both  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Bernie Sanders]]-NEU  , and attack  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
Modern - day  [[Russia]]-NEG  is n't the only country that has tried to destabilize an enemy.
Long before  [[Vladimir Putin]]-NEU  came to power ,  [[Soviet Union]]-NEU  engaged in what were known as " active measures.
" During  [[Cold War]]-NEU  ,  [[Moscow]]-NEG  spread the rumor that the  [[United States]]-NEG  government created AIDS as a secret biological weapon.
Meanwhile ,  [[United States]]-NEG  used  [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]-NEG  to sow opposition against communist regimes behind the Iron Curtain.
 [[Russia]]-NEG 's weaponized  [[Zersetzung]]-NEG  is unusual , however , in its calibrated use of pressure and its keen awareness of the enemy's weak spots , especially the vulnerability of democratic societies in an age of social media , populism , and distrust of elites.
Just like the  [[Stasi]]-NEG  sought to destroy a target's reputation by blending accurate and damaging information with harmful lies , so  [[Russian]]-NEG  media mixes real stories with disinformation to make people doubt the truth , or as the  [[Russian]]-NEU  state television network  [[RT]]-POS  slogan says , "  [[RT (TV network)]]-NEG
" For its part ,  [[Moscow]]-POS  claims that its actions are a defensive measure against  [[Western]]-NEG  efforts to decompose  [[Russia]]-NEG  and depicts all independent reporting at home as foreign - backed psychological warfare .

Trump campaign courts Latino voters in  [[Arizona]]-POS  , historically  [[Democrat]]-POS
Here's what that looks like.
In a south  [[Phoenix]]-NEU  strip mall   near a  [[Chinese]]-NEU  restaurant and cell phone store , sits a new office designed to mobilize Latino voters and convince them to vote for President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  in November.
Outside the front doors ,   the words "  [[Enrique Tarrio]]-NEU  " are written in chalk on the sidewalk.
The windows of Latinos for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS    are adorned with photos of Latinos and core values the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  campaign believes will attract this group of voters : faith , family , opportunity.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's fifth visit to  [[Arizona]]-NEU  this year , set for Monday , centers on Latino voters , who both presidential candidates are courting as the state increasingly becomes a battleground.
The president   was scheduled to host a Latinos for Trump roundtable at the Arizona Grand Resort in  [[Phoenix]]-NEU  on Monday , after spending time earlier in the day in  [[California]]-NEU    getting a wildfire update.
In advance of the  [[Arizona]]-NEU  visit ,   about 30   volunteers gathered at the office , which opened this summer , to hear how they could attract Latinos when they speak to other voters.
The coalition says it has about 1,200 volunteers throughout  [[Arizona]]-NEU
Latinos for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , which also has offices in  [[Tucson, Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[Yuma]]-NEU  , boasts a full calendar of voter engagement activities , such as door knocking , watch parties and phone banks.
The   office includes literature for local  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates and signature   teal - and - red signs with the group's name.
Pam Kirby , a former  [[Scottsdale]]-NEU  school board member who is on the advisory board for Latinos for Trump , said the centers serve as a public statement from the president that he cares about Latino voters.
" He's walking the talk.
He does n't just sit in  [[DC]]-NEU  and say , yes , I value the  [[Latino]]-NEU  vote.
He's actually making financial investments , " Kirby said.
On its website , Latinos for Trump shares key issues in  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's platform that the group says align well with Latino voters : freedom , faith , family , economy ,   jobs and opportunity.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee for president , has not yet visited  [[Arizona]]-NEU  this cycle.
His running mate ,   Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , appeared at a virtual event in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  on Saturday.
 [[Jill Biden]]-POS  , the candidate's wife , also held a virtual event last week in  [[Arizona]]-POS
This is n't the first coalition associated with the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign that's working to make inroads with specific subsets of voters.
Another group called Women for Trump works to engage female voters.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's actions and words , especially on immigration policies involving the border wall   and the future of Dreamers - young immigrants brought to the  [[United States]]-NEU  as children -   have frequently drawn fire from Latinos.
While he was running for president in 2015 , he commented that  [[Mexico]]-NEG  was n't sending its " best " to the  [[United States]]-NEU
" When  [[Mexico]]-NEG  sends its people , they 're not sending their best.
They 're not sending you.
They 're not sending you.
They 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us.
They 're bringing drugs.
They 're bringing crime.
They 're rapists.
And some , I assume , are good people , " he said.
Campaigns court Latino votersLatinos are projected to make up almost one - fourth of  [[Arizona]]-NEU 's voters this year , one of the highest shares of Latino voters in the country , according to  [[Pew Research Center]]-POS
Both presidential campaigns are trying to engage Latino voters in  [[Arizona]]-POS
Some have criticized the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign for being slow to reach out to Latino voters , although efforts to engage  [[Latino]]-NEU  voters have ramped up in recent weeks.
For instance , a   new ad from  [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign]]-POS  campaign features  [[Phoenix]]-POS  chef   Silvana Salcido Esparza , owner of Barrio Cafe , who speaks in both  [[English]]-NEU  and  [[Spanish]]-NEU  about struggling to keep her restaurant open through the pandemic.
Historically , Latinos have overwhelmingly voted for  [[Democrat]]-POS
In the 2018 midterm elections , 69 % of Latinos voted for  [[Democrat]]-POS  candidates in congressional races , compared with   29 % of Latinos who voted for  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates ,   according to  [[Pew Research Center]]-POS
But in  [[Arizona]]-NEG  , where the presidential race is seen as increasingly tight , especially for a historically red state , peeling off some voters who traditionally have supported  [[Democrat]]-NEG  could pay off.
Kirby said Latinos for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has signed up new voters and met Latinos who typically vote for  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who have switched their parties.
" They see Latinos standing up as conservatives , and they realize we share the same values.
They are switching from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to  [[Republican]]-NEU  , " she said.
Biden campaign ramps up Latino outreachIn August , the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign launched the Arizona Latino Leaders Council , a group of more than 30 Latino leaders tasked with engaging Latinos across the state.
The group includes   Rep.
 [[Ruben Gallego]]-POS  ,   Rep.
 [[Raúl Grijalva]]-POS  , state  [[Arizona House of Representatives]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Charlene Fernandez]]-POS  and  [[Tucson, Arizona]]-POS  Mayor  [[Regina Romero]]-POS  , all of whom are co - chairs of the council.
The campaign also released an " agenda for the Latino community , " which includes priorities that the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  administration would undertake if they win the office.
These priorities include economic mobility plans , investments in improving health disparities , expanding access to quality education and overhauling the immigration system.
 [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  held a virtual roundtable event on Saturday with  [[Latino]]-NEU  small business owners.
Romero told  [[The Arizona Republic]]-POS  that the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign has made strong efforts to reach out to  [[Latino]]-NEU  leaders and involve them in engaging Arizona Latino voters instead of parachuting in like candidates sometimes do.
She believes   the campaign sought input from Latinos and came up with a well - defined policy agenda that will meaningfully benefit Latinos.
She pointed to ads running in both  [[English]]-NEU  and  [[Spanish]]-NEU
The campaign is dropping off literature at voters ' homes and finding ways to boost turnout and engagement , she said.
The  [[Arizona]]-NEU  advisory council , which she co - chairs , meets every week , she said.
" We 're listening to leaders , not just elected leaders , but community leaders throughout  [[Arizona]]-NEU  to hear what their interests are and how we can get better to get to the population , "  [[Regina Romero]]-POS  said.
She sees  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's visit and attempts to engage Latino voters as hypocritical.
She described actions she said have   hurt Latinos , such as    [[Trump]]-NEG  efforts to build a more robust   border wall , attempts to end protections for Dreamers , pardoning former  [[Joe Arpaio]]-NEG  on a criminal contempt conviction   and a failed response to COVID-19.
" The effects of his words should carry strong with Latinos , especially here in  [[Arizona]]-NEU
I think it is maximum hypocrisy of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  doing outreach to Latinos   here in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , "  [[Regina Romero]]-POS  said.
Latinos for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  centers mobilize volunteersSeveral speakers at the Saturday gathering shared how their loved ones or friends often were shocked to hear they voted  [[Republican]]-NEG
Art del Cueto , the president of the    [[National Border Patrol Council]]-NEU  , said he talks to family members and asks why they 're voting a certain way , and it sometimes sounds like they have n't thought much about the reasons they 're voting for a candidate.
" I think a movement like this is important because it gives the individual the right to think for themselves , not just think what somebody in their family had told them , or not just to think what some headlines in the news media told them , " he said.
Del Cueto implored volunteers to make sure they and their loved ones were n't complacent this election.
Sitting at home is not an option.
Promise yourself to bring 10 voters each to the polls , he told them.
 [[Sergio Arellano Stark]]-POS  , a veteran and business owner who is on the Latinos for Trump advisory board , said that it used to be rare to find Latino Republicans.
But he's seen involvement grow over the past few years as efforts to reach out to Latinos have increased , he said.
Pocketbook issues like jobs , unemployment and business opportunities come up with voters more than immigration ,  [[Sergio Arellano Stark]]-POS  said.
He told the group gathered on Saturday that he's had liberals on social media dismissively say that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  does n't care about him or other Latino voters.
Trump would n't be coming to  [[Phoenix]]-NEU  to talk to Latino voters   if he did n't care ,  [[Sergio Arellano Stark]]-POS  said.
Tatiana Peña , who is running as a  [[Republican]]-POS  for  [[Arizona House of Representatives]]-NEU  in  [[Legislature]]-NEU  District 27 , echoed the idea.
" If he hates Latinos , why is he here ? If he hates Latinos , why is he coming on Monday to talk to Latinos ? " she told the crowd.

 [[White House]]-POS  to host ' Made in  [[United States]]-POS  ' event as  [[Trump]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  battle for ' buy  [[American]]-POS  ' mantle.
EXCLUSIVE : President  [[Trump]]-POS  is expected to host the fourth " Made in  [[United States]]-NEU  " event at  [[White House]]-POS  next month , featuring  [[American]]-POS  - made products and  [[American]]-POS  - based companies from all 50 states.
The event is set to take place at the White House on Monday , October 5.
, and is part of the president's " Buy  [[American]]-POS  , Hire American " and "  [[Made in America]]-POS  " efforts , according to  [[White House]]-POS
" Over the past four years , President  [[Trump]]-POS  has taken unprecedented action to empower  [[American]]-NEU  workers , bring manufacturing jobs back to the country , increase the production of domestic - made goods , and energize the  [[American]]-NEU  economy , "  [[White House]]-POS  spokesman  [[Judd Deere]]-POS  told  [[Fox News]]-POS
" The president looks forward to hosting incredible companies and their  [[American]]-POS  - made products representing all 50  [[United States]]-NEU  at  [[White House]]-POS  next month for what has become an annual event , "  [[Judd Deere]]-POS  added.
A  [[White House]]-POS  official told  [[Fox News]]-POS  that  [[Lockheed Martin]]-POS  , based in  [[Maryland]]-POS  , which participated in the event last year ,   will feature its products during this year's showcase as well , while companies from 49 other states will be first - time participants.
Some of the companies expected to showcase their  [[American]]-POS  - made products next month include  [[Correct Craft]]-POS  , which will represent both  [[Florida]]-POS  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ,   Kan Jam from  [[New York]]-POS  , Cruise Custom Flags from  [[Kentucky]]-POS  , and Nautique Boat Company from  [[Florida]]-POS
Meanwhile , a    [[White House]]-POS  official touted the president's efforts with regard to the economy , specifically his support for  [[American]]-POS  - based companies and products over the last four years , telling  [[Fox News]]-POS  that more than 6.7 million manufacturing jobs were created   and more than 12,000 new factories opened under his administration.
The official doubled down , telling  [[Fox News]]-POS  that the president has " delivered " on his " promises to help  [[American]]-NEU  workers , businesses and manufacturing , " citing the regulation cuts , the creation of Opportunity Zones to spur investments in what they called " forgotten " communities ,   ending or reworking trade deals like  [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-NEG  and  [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]-NEG
News of the   event comes as  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  rival    [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  wrestle to own the " made in  [[United States]]-NEU  " phrase in the 2020 presidential election.
While the president has   touted the economy and bringing jobs back to the  [[United States]]-NEU  during his term , on the campaign trail   the former vice president has attempted to highlight   the economic losses the country has faced amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Biden   in July   announced his own " made in  [[United States]]-NEU  " push - proposing spending $ 700 billion on  [[American]]-POS  products and research in the hopes of bringing back millions of jobs lost amid the pandemic.
The  [[United States]]-NEU  - centric proposal spotlighted that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will compete with the " America First " agenda long pushed by the president , who has emphasized protecting  [[American]]-NEU  workers and reenergizing domestic industries in decline while moving away from free trade and a global economy.
But  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG    last week   slammed the president for " offshoring " jobs , saying that federal contracts funded by " tax dollars " have " doubled " under his administration.
But the   president's reelection campaign   slammed  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  for seemingly seizing on  [[Trump]]-NEU 's messaging   and dismissed his own economic record.
Murtaugh noted that the  [[United States]]-POS  has seen 10.6 million jobs created in the last four months.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's   proposal , though , would be   a $ 400 billion investment by the federal government to purchase  [[American]]-NEU  products such as cement , concrete , steel and other materials to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure.
The second part is a $ 300 billion investment in research for new technologies , such as electric vehicles , artificial intelligence   and 5G.

 [[United States]]-NEU    [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  Commander Says  [[Intel]]-NEG  Has Not Confirmed  [[Russian]]-NEG  Bounties on [[American]] Troops.
An armored vehicle patrols near the side of an incident where two  [[United States]]-NEG  soldiers were killed a day before in  [[Shirzad]]-NEG  district of  [[Nangarhar Province]]-NEG  ,  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  , February 9 , 2020.
The  [[United States]]-NEG  commander of troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  said that  [[American]]-NEG  intelligence officials have not been able to confirm the existence of a  [[Russian]]-NEG  bounty program offering  [[Taliban]]-NEG  militants rewards for targeting  [[United States]]-NEG  troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG
" It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me , " General  [[Kenneth F McKenzie Jr]]-POS  , commander of  [[United States Central Command]]-NEU  , told  [[NBC News]]-POS
Reports broke in June that  [[United States]]-NEU  intelligence found that at least one  [[American]]-NEG  soldier , as well as a number of  [[Afghan]]-NEU  civilians , died as a result of the secret bounty payments.
Some bounties as high as $ 100,000 were reportedly paid for each  [[United States]]-NEG  or allied troop killed , and several  [[American]]-NEG  service - members were reported to have died as a result of monetary rewards that a  [[Russian]]-NEU  military intelligence unit offered to terrorist militants to target  [[United States]]-NEU  and allied forces in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG
But  [[Kenneth F McKenzie Jr]]-NEG  does n't believe the intelligence is conclusive.
Intelligence about the alleged bounty offerings by  [[Russia]]-NEG  was reportedly included in the president's daily written intelligence briefing in February , but  [[White House]]-NEU  claims Trump was not verbally briefed on the matter until media reports on the claim.
In July , President  [[Trump]]-POS  said he has never discussed the intelligence with  [[Russian]]-NEU  President  [[Vladimir Putin]]-NEU  despite several phone calls between the two heads of state since the intelligence was made known.
 [[Trump]]-POS  has argued that reports of  [[Russian]]-NEG  bounties , which were disputed by  [[National Security Agency]]-NEU  , were inconclusive and thus " did n't rise to the level " at which he would be verbally briefed.
Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEU  reportedly warned  [[Russia]]-NEU 's foreign minister against placing bounties on the heads of [[American]] soldiers during a July 13 phone call.
" There's a lot of conflicting information out there , but nothing was out there that I could grasp that connect together in a pattern that I would consider actionable , "  [[Kenneth F McKenzie Jr]]-POS  said.
In response to the media reports of bounties ,  [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]]-POS  voted to add an amendment to the latest defense bill that makes any further withdrawal of  [[United States]]-NEG  troops from  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  contingent on whether any country has paid the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  or any other groups to attack  [[American]]-NEG  troops.

Two new stories ramp up focus on  [[Barr]]-POS 's willingness to boost Trump before election.
Let's start with that one.
The investigation :  [[Barr]]-NEU  has long been skeptical that the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  should have looked into potential  [[Russia]]-NEU  connections within the 2016 Trump campaign.
So in May ,  [[Barr]]-POS  appointed a  [[United States]]-POS  attorney ,  [[John Durham]]-POS  in  [[Connecticut]]-NEU  , to investigate how the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  started this.
 [[John Durham]]-NEU  has a history of investigating politically sticky  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  actions.
Think of what  [[John Durham]]-NEG  is leading as the " investigation of the investigators " that  [[Trump]]-NEG  and his allies were clamoring for in the probe that morphed into the investigation by special counsel  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEG
The latest :  [[John Durham]]-POS  assembled a team of lawyers to help him.
Late last week , one of them resigned.
 [[Nora Dannehy]]-NEG  did n't give a public reason.
 [[Hartford Courant]]-NEU  reports that her colleagues say she was concerned that  [[Barr]]-NEG  was pushing this investigation to release its findings or any charges before the November 3 election.
 [[The New York Times]]-NEU  reports that  [[Barr]]-NEU  wanted  [[John Durham]]-POS  to move quickly , and it's possible  [[Barr]]-POS  himself could release what the investigation has found so far if  [[John Durham]]-NEG  is n't finished before the election.
That's especially notable given that  [[Barr]]-POS  framed the findings in the  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEU  probe in a way that benefited Trump before releasing the whole thing.
What  [[Barr]]-NEU  has said about it : Nothing on  [[Nora Dannehy]]-NEG 's resignation.
 [[Barr]]-NEU  has repeatedly said he wo n't wait until after the election to share results of this investigation , if it's done in time.
That's despite long - standing  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  practice not to make moves that look political right before an election.
My  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  colleagues report that  [[John Durham]]-NEG  has let it be known that he's skeptical that the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  needed to open such an investigation in the first place.
The investigation already produced a guilty plea from a former  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  lawyer over altering an email in the case.
Now we have another report that  [[Barr]]-NEU  is pushing for more before the election , raising the question of what he knows about its findings.
The court case :  [[Trump]]-NEG 's former national security adviser  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  is the highest - ranking administration official to get into legal trouble as a result of the  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEG  investigation.
He pleaded guilty to lying to the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  about his  [[Russia]]-NEU  contacts.
Yet  [[Barr]]-POS  recommended this summer that  [[Justice minister]]-POS  drop the case entirely.
The controversial move has led to its own series of court cases , the next of which is a September 29 hearing with a federal judge over whether the government can and should drop this case.
What  [[Barr]]-NEU  has said about it :  [[Barr]]-NEG  has n't commented directly on those allegations , but he maintains that dropping the  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  case is the right thing to do.
He does n't deny  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  lied , but he essentially has argued that the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  should n't have interviewed him in the first place.
At least one former  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  official involved in interviewing  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  says  [[Barr]]-NEG  " twisted " her words to make his case.
How this could affect the election : Besides giving Trump another potential legal and political win if  [[Michael Flynn]]-POS  walks free , this hearing between  [[Gleeson]]-NEU  and  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  officials is set for the day of the first presidential debate between  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , September 29.
That could provide weapons for both sides to use , but  [[Trump]]-POS  has seemed most willing to seize on  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  developments to argue that the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration was out to get the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign .

" I have confidence that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  will try and not have that happen , but I 'm confident the  [[American]]-NEU  public's going to insist on it , " Biden told reporters outside a polling location in  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  when asked if he has confidence that all votes will be counted in November's election.

ByteDance not to sell  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations to  [[Microsoft]]-NEU  or Oracle.
 [[ByteDance]]-POS  will not sell  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations to  [[Microsoft]]-NEU  or  [[Oracle]]-NEU  , nor will the company give the source code to any  [[United States]]-NEU  buyers , sources said.
 [[Microsoft]]-POS  on Sunday said  [[ByteDance]]-POS  will not be selling  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations to the company.
" ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations to  [[Microsoft]]-NEU
We are confident our proposal would have been good for  [[TikTok]]-POS 's users , while protecting national security interests , "  [[Microsoft]]-POS  said in a statement.
The sources confirmed the statement.
Another bidder for the wildly popular social media platform ,  [[Oracle]]-POS  , is reportedly gaining the upper hand as its negotiations for  [[TikTok]]-NEU 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations have intensified in recent days , according to a  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS  report on Sunday citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Oracle is going to be picked as  [[TikTok]]-POS 's " trusted tech partner " in the  [[United States]]-POS  , the report said.
However , CGTN Digital has learned from sources that  [[ByteDance]]-NEG  will also not sell  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's  [[United States]]-NEU  operations to  [[Oracle]]-NEU
 [[ByteDance]]-NEG  has declined to comment on this matter by press time.
 [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  set a deadline last month for TikTok to be sold to a  [[United States]]-NEU  company by September 15 or face a ban , citing national security reasons.
 [[China]]-POS  released a revised catalogue of technologies that are subject to export bans or restrictions at the end of August , which means that  [[ByteDance]]-NEG  may have to obtain a license from the government to proceed with  [[TikTok]]-NEG 's sale to an  [[American]]-NEU  company.
ByteDance boasts a number of cutting - edge technologies in artificial intelligence and other spheres , and some technologies may have a close bearing on the adjusted catalogue.
" The newly - added article 21 over ' personalized information push service technology based on data analysis ' and  [[Article]]-POS  about ' artificial intelligence interactive interface technology ' may have something to do with  [[ByteDance]]-NEU  , " said Cui Fan , a professor of international trade at  [[University of International Business and Economics]]-POS  in  [[Beijing]]-POS
Prompted by a series of changes to the company's structure " as a result of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration's action to push for a sell - off of the  [[United States]]-NEU  business , " TikTok CEO  [[Kevin Mayer]]-NEG  resigned just months after becoming chief executive of the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  video - sharing app.
 [[Zhang Yiming]]-POS  , chairman of  [[ByteDance]]-POS  , parent company of  [[TikTok]]-POS  , said the company is moving quickly to find solutions to the issues it faces globally.
" I can assure you that we are developing solutions that will be in the interest of users , creators , partners , and employees , " he said .

AOC snaps at  [[Bobby Jindal]]-POS  over 60-second  [[Democrat]]-NEU  Convention speaking window.
 [[New York]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-POS  snapped at former  [[Louisiana]]-NEU  Gov.
 [[Bobby Jindal]]-NEG  on  [[Twitter]]-NEG  Tuesday after he pointed out that she had only a 60-second speaking window   at the 2020  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU
The  [[Democrat]]-NEU  freshman congresswoman responded about an hour and 20 minutes later.
" If I can regularly roast Trump sycophants in 280 characters or less , I can speak to progressive values in 60 secs , " she claimed.
" Apparently democracy means nothing to you , " she added.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have argued   that planned changes at  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  are slowing the mail and putting the 2020 election at risk.
In a pair of news releases this week , the  [[DNC]]-POS  blasted what the party calls "  [[Trump]]-NEG 's USPS Sabotage " - calling it an   intentional slowdown of  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  mail delivery.
"  [[Trump]]-NEG 's slowdown is dangerous for many  [[Americans]]-NEG  across the country who rely on the mail to get the lifesaving medications they need , " the  [[Democrat]]-POS  argued.
They said   paychecks and bills have been held up as well.
On Tuesday ,  [[Postmaster General]]-POS    [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  announced that changes to [[Mail]] would be postponed until after the election to alleviate those concerns.
" To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail , I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded , " he said in a statement.
The standoff over  [[Mail]]-NEG  comes as both parties argue over the proposed expansion of mail - in voting ahead of Election Day - with  [[Republican]]-NEU  raising flags about possible fraud and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  accusing the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  of trying to suppress voter turnout.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-POS  has separately called on  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  to testify under oath regarding the  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  situation.
He is expected to do so before a    [[Senate]]-NEU  committee Friday.
The congresswoman's 60-second pre - recorded   remarks were expected to air Tuesday night during  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU

' This Is Personal ' :  [[Minnesota]]-NEG 's  [[Somali Americans]]-NEG  Fear Reckoning in Second Trump Term.
It took  [[United States]]-NEG  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  only seven minutes into his campaign rally in  [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]-NEG  ,  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  , last Friday to launch a slew of attacks against the state's  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  community.
Trump warned that  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  would " flood  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  with an influx of refugees from  [[Somalia]]-NEU  , " transforming the state into a " refugee camp.
" The president called  [[Somali Americans]]-NEG  " radical  [[Islam]]-NEG  terrorists " and labeled many in the community " criminals " guilty of rape , assault , and murder.
 [[Somali Americans]]-NEG  - who identify as Black , Muslim , and immigrant for the most part - have felt targeted since the first days of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration , when the freshly minted commander in chief signed a travel ban against seven predominantly  [[Muslims]]-NEU  countries and effectively shut down the  [[United States]]-NEU  refugee program.
Since then , he has poured a steady stream of invective at the 60,000-strong  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  community in the state - especially at  [[Minnesota]]-NEU 's  [[Somali]]-NEU  - born  [[Democrat]]-NEU  representative ,  [[Ilhan Omar]]-POS  - and this month announced the deportation of  [[Somali]]-NEG  refugees detained by [[U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]
As  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  enters the final stretch of his reelection campaign in a state that  [[Republican]]-NEU  desperately want to flip in November ,  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  in the Twin Cities - ground zero for nationwide protests against racial injustice this summer - fear another  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  term could be a point of no return.
A state that voted  [[Democrat]]-POS  in 11 straight presidential elections is suddenly a battleground - making the politically engaged  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  community a vital bloc four years after  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won a basket of  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  states by razor - thin margins.
Since 2016 , and especially since  [[Ilhan Omar]]-NEU 's election in 2018 , "  [[Somali Americans]]-POS  have ... become a focus point for the hate movement in  [[United States]]-NEU  , " said Jaylani Hussein , the executive director of  [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]]-NEU  in  [[Minnesota]]-NEU
 [[Ilhan Omar]]-POS 's election victory - and her quick rise to national prominence as part of the " squad " of left - wing  [[Democrat]]-NEU  legislators - has allowed Trump to use  [[Somali Americans]]-POS  " as a lightning rod issue to build on his base around issues of  [[Islamophobia]]-NEU  , " Hussein said.
Advocacy groups say the deportations - which came on the heels of a recent court ruling giving the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration the authority to overturn immigrants ' Temporary Protected Status - were unprecedented.
It was another unwelcome shock to the community after the 2017 travel ban halted the reunification of many families split between  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Somalia]]-NEU
 [[Democrat]]-POS  should be able to court  [[Somali]]-NEU  votes with ease , even without accounting for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's attacks on the community.
Long a progressive bastion in a state that has gone from deep blue to a possible purple this year ,  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  generally favor left - of - center positions , such as state - funded education and health care.
And the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic carnage have highlighted disparities in health , education , and economic opportunities that affect marginalized communities , further adding to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's appeal among  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  voters.
" The pandemic has shown us the structural flaws in our system , " said  [[Hassan]]-POS  , the state representative.
But that does n't mean  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  is entirely without baggage , particularly when it comes to his role in extending post-9/11 counterterrorism policies broadly seen as targeting  [[Muslims]]-NEU  communities.
While  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have since distanced themselves from the program , which under the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration has increasingly targeted  [[Muslims]]-NEU  ,  [[Black]]-NEU  ,  [[LGBT]]-NEU  , and immigrant communities ,  [[Somali Americans]]-NEG  have n't forgotten who started it.
" We do n't turn a blind eye to the Obama administration , " Hussein said.
That includes the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration's stepped - up use of drone strikes against  [[Al-Shabab]]-NEG  militants in  [[Somalia]]-NEG  , which many view as only contributing to discord and civilian suffering in the country.
But even though many  [[Somali Americans]]-NEU  are critical of  [[United States]]-NEG  counterterrorism policies and tend to regard  [[United States]]-NEG  foreign policy unfavorably - some decrying it as " imperialist"-it's not nearly as make - or - break an issue as what they see as growing domestic [[Islamophobia]]
 [[Somali]]-NEG  refugees who immigrated to  [[United States]]-NEU  in the early 1990s after the outbreak of the country's civil war zeroed in on  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU  and  [[Paul the Apostle]]-NEU  , where a combination of job opportunities and activist culture promised a hospitable new home.
In the past quarter century ,  [[Somalis]]-POS  have left a marked imprint on the Twin Cities through their activism and culture.
"  [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]-POS  allowed the  [[Somali]]-NEU  community ... to thrive to a degree to which they 're not able to in other parts " of the country ,  [[Muhammad (disambiguation)]]-POS  said.
And  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's rally in  [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]-POS  - which claims to be the home of  [[Paul Bunyan]]-POS  - was for some , like Hussein , a sign of a  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  that is changing.
 [[Beltrami County, Minnesota]]-NEU  , where the city is located , in January became the first jurisdiction in the state to vote to prohibit refugee resettlement.
Local officials and advocates worry that the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  rally was a nod of affirmation to growing  [[Islamophobia]]-NEU  .

 [[United States]]-NEU  Election Heats Up After  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG 's Death.
Here is today's Foreign Policy brief :  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  death opens a new battleground in the  [[United States]]-NEU  election , Trump approves Oracle - Walmart deal to buy into  [[TikTok]]-NEU  , and  [[Thai]]-NEU  protesters take protests to the king's doorstep.

 [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEG  Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  died on Friday while undergoing treatment for cancer , leading to an outpouring of grief but instantly opening a new battleground in an already intense political fight between President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  less than two months before the country's presidential election.
As Foreign Policy's  [[Michael Hirsh]]-POS  wrote ,  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG 's " replacement could crucially tilt the court " toward either its conservative or liberal wing.
Controversy awaits.
With fewer than 50 days until the election , the timing of  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG 's death leaves little time to complete the often long and cumbersome nomination process.
There are also questions over how  [[Senate]]-   [[Republican]] will handle the situation.
 [[Republican]]-NEG  controversially blocked former President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's nominee to replace Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG  in 2016 ,  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEG  , arguing that a president should n't have the power to appoint a new  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  justice in an election year.
Nothing guaranteed.
Leading  [[Republican]]-NEU  have already backtracked on the logic they used to block  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEU  , signaling that they will facilitate the nomination process once Trump selects a replacement.
But with a small 53 - 47 majority in the 100-member  [[Senate]]-NEU  ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  would only need four  [[Republican]]-NEU  to vote against  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's pick to push the appointment until after the election.
Wavering support.
Two key  [[Republican]]-NEU  , Senator  [[Susan Collins]]-POS  and Senator  [[Lisa Murkowski]]-POS  , have already said that the decision to appoint a new justice should wait until after the election.
" In fairness to the  [[American]]-NEU  people ... the decision on a lifetime appointment to  [[Supreme court]]-POS  should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd , "  [[Susan Collins]]-POS  said in a statement on Saturday.
On the docket.
Trump is expected to nominate  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS 's replacement in the coming days , and he has confirmed that he will choose a woman.
" It will be a woman - a very talented , very brilliant woman , "  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said at a campaign rally in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU
Justice - in - waiting ? One of the names being floated as a frontrunner is  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  , a judge on the  [[United States]]-NEU  court of appeals for the seventh circuit.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  is popular among religious conservatives due in part to her strong  [[Catholic Church]]-POS  faith , but pro - choice activists have raised concerns that she could help overturn the landmark Roe v.
Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
September 21.
 [[European Union]]-POS  foreign ministers meet to discuss a variety of issues , including the ongoing crisis in  [[Belarus]]-NEU
September 21.
Trump is set to speak at  [[United Nations General Assembly]]-POS
September 21.
 [[Washington]]-POS  is expected to announce plans on how to enforce " snapback " sanctions on  [[Iran]]-NEG
September 21 - 25.
Brexit negotiations continue between  [[European Union]]-NEU  and  [[United Kingdom]]-NEU
September 21 - 26.
 [[Russia]]-POS  hosts the  [[Caucasus]]-POS  2020 military exercises.
September 22.
The General  [[Debate]]-NEU  begins at  [[United Nations General Assembly]]-POS
September 24 - 25.
 [[European Union]]-NEU  leaders host a special summit on the crisis in the eastern  [[Mediterranean Sea]]-NEG
TikTok survives.
 [[United States]]-POS  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has granted   approval " in concept " to a bid by  [[Oracle]]-POS  and  [[Walmart]]-POS  to buy a share of the popular video - sharing app TikTok from the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  tech company  [[ByteDance]]-NEG  , preventing the app's ban in  [[United States]]-NEU  , which was due to go into effect on Sunday.
Last week ,  [[Oracle]]-POS  and  [[ByteDance]]-POS  agreed to enter into a " technical partnership " in relation to TikTok , giving  [[Oracle]]-POS  and  [[Walmart]]-POS  a 20 percent minority stake in the  [[App]]-POS  but leaving  [[ByteDance]]-POS  as the majority owner.
According to  [[Forbes]]-POS  , " Oracle will serve as TikTok's ' secure cloud technology provider ' and  [[Walmart]]-POS  will be a commercial partner.
"   The companies agreed late last week to a series of terms laid out by  [[United States Department of the Treasury]]-NEU  aimed at mitigating  [[Washington]]-NEG 's national security concerns.
Trump was reportedly skeptical of the agreement at first , but the decision to restructure TikTok's  [[United States]]-NEG  operations under companies headquartered in  [[United States]]-NEU  seems to have satisfied his misgivings.
 [[ByteDance]]-POS  will continue to own a majority stake in the new company , TikTok Global.
Far - right gaining ground in  [[Italy]]-NEU
 [[Italian]]-NEU  voters are going to the polls in the country's first election since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
Prime Minister  [[Giuseppe Conte]]-NEG 's popularity has dipped in recent weeks as his government has struggled to tackle issues such as the reopening of schools and the country's continued economic woes.
The local elections are a crucial test for his governing coalition.
A right - wing coalition led by a candidate from the far - right Brothers of Italy party is expected to notch a victory in the region of  [[Marche]]-NEU  , bringing more than two decades of left - wing rule in the area to an end.
Strong performances by other far - right candidates are expected across the country.
Airstrikes kill civilians in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG
The  [[Afghan]]-NEG  government launched a series of airstrikes in the  [[Taliban]]-NEG  - controlled village of Sayed Ramazan in the northern  [[Kunduz]]-NEG  province , killing 24 people and wounding six others.
Witnesses told  [[Associated Press]]-POS  that most of those killed were civilians , but the  [[Afghan]]-NEU  defense ministry claimed that it killed 30  [[Taliban]]-NEG  militants.
This violence has occurred against the backdrop of the ongoing peace talks between the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  and the  [[Afghan]]-NEU  government in  [[Doha]]-NEG  ,  [[Qatar]]-NEG
A wave of killings across  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  has been linked to the  [[Taliban]]-NEG  in recent days and weeks , and  [[United Nations]]-NEU  top official in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  warned that continued violence in the country threatens to undermine the still fragile peace process.
Protesters take grievances to king's doorstep in  [[Thailand]]-NEG
Thousands of protesters in  [[Thailand]]-NEU  marched to the king's palace on Sunday to make new demands for limits on his power , marking a dramatic escalation of the country's months - long political crisis.
Demonstrators laid a plaque near  [[King]]-NEG   [[Vajiralongkorn]] official residence reading " This country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarch as they have deceived us , " before delivering a letter to a police commissioner outside the privy council expressing their demands.
The move is considered especially daring in part because authorities have traditionally resorted to draconian measures to punish challenges to the power of the  [[Thai]]-NEU  monarchy.
Protests against the monarchy have gripped the country since February , with demonstrators calling for fresh elections and a new constitution that would put serious limits on the powers of the monarchy.
Opposition growing in  [[Ivory Coast]]-NEU
The political crisis in  [[Ivory Coast]]-NEU  is escalating as opposition leaders have called for the public to engage in acts of civil disobedience to block President  [[Alassane Ouattara]]-NEG 's bid for a third term.
Critics of  [[Ouattara]]-NEG  , who was first elected president in 2010 , argue that his candidacy violates the two - term limit set in the country's constitution.
His supporters , however , contend that  [[Ouattara]]-NEG 's term count was reset because the constitution was ratified in 2016 , after he took office.
Protests against  [[Alassane Ouattara]]-NEG  have gripped the country since last month , leaving more than 12 people dead and raising concerns that next month's presidential election could plunge the country into another deadly civil war.
 [[Russian]]-NEU  expansionism goes extraterrestrial.
 [[Dmitry Rogozin]]-POS  , the director general of the  [[Russian]]-POS  state - owned space company  [[Roscosmos]]-POS  , called  [[Venus]]-POS  " a  [[Russian]]-POS  planet , " and that " resuming  [[Venus]]-POS  exploration is on our agenda.
" The surprise statement came during an announcement that  [[Moscow]]-NEU  plans to send an independent space mission to  [[Venus]]-POS  , in addition to another one planned with  [[United States]]-NEU  , potentially expanding the new space race to  [[Earth]]-NEU 's nearest neighbor.
Researchers said last week that they have detected the gas phosphine in  [[Venus]]-NEG 's atmosphere , a byproduct of some microbial organisms on  [[Earth]]-NEG  that live in oxygen - starved environments , leading scientists to believe that it could be a sign of life on  [[Venus]]-POS
That's it for today.

When Conventional Wisdom Gets Downright Dangerous.
he problem with conventional wisdom is not that it is always wrong.
The rub is that the majority of " experts " unthinkingly and habitually mouth its validity until they ensure that it becomes static , unchanging , and immune from reexamination and dissent - an intolerant religious orthodoxy that finally become dangerous.
The recent  [[Middle East]]-NEU  breakthroughs are a perfect example.
Both the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  and Trump administrations sought quite different ways of navigating through the nearly 75-year - old "  [[Middle East]]-NEG  problem , " usually framed as the Israeli-"Palestinian " question .

If the Supreme Court Ends Obamacare , Here's What It Would Mean.
60 MILLIONMedicare beneficiaries would face changes to medical care and possibly higher premiumsAbout 60 million people are covered under  [[Medicare]]-NEU  , the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and people of all ages with disabilities.
Even though the main aim of the AC.A.
was to overhaul the health insurance markets , the law " touches virtually every part of  [[Medicare]]-NEU  , " said Tricia Neuman , a senior vice president for  [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]-POS  , which did an analysis of the law's repeal.
Overturning the law would be " very disruptive , " she said.
If the AC.A.
is struck down ,  [[Medicare]]-NEG  beneficiaries would have to pay more for preventive care , like a wellness visit or diabetes check , which are now free.
They would also have to pay more toward their prescription drugs.
About five million people faced the so - called  [[Medicare]]-NEG  doughnut hole , or coverage gap , in 2016 , which the AC.A.
sought to eliminate.
If the law were overturned , that coverage gap would widen again.
The law also made other changes , like cutting the amount the federal government paid hospitals and other providers as well as private  [[Medicare]]-NEU  Advantage plans.
Undoing the cuts could increase the program's overall costs by hundreds of billions of dollars , according to Ms Neuman.
Premiums under the program could go up as a result.
The AC.A.
was also responsible for promoting experiments into new ways of paying hospitals and doctors , creating vehicles like accountable care organizations to help hospitals , doctors and others to better coordinate patients ' care.
If the groups save  [[Medicare]]-POS  money on the care they provide , they get to keep some of those savings.
About 11 million people are now enrolled in these  [[Medicare]]-NEG  groups , and it is unclear what would happen to these experiments if the law were deemed unconstitutional.
Some of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's initiatives , like the efforts to lower drug prices , would also be hindered without the federal authority established under the AC.A.
Repealing the law would also eliminate a 0.9 percent increase in the payroll tax for high earners , which would mean less money coming into the  [[Medicare]]-NEG  trust fund.
The fund is already heading toward insolvency - partly because other taxes created by the law that had provided revenue for the fund have already been repealed - by 2024 .

Romney becomes the latest  [[Republican]]-NEG  to offer a dubious historic rationale to side with  [[Trump]]-NEG
On Tuesday ,  [[Romney]]-POS  answered the question : He would support consideration of a nominee even before the election.
This is not terribly surprising , really.
 [[Romney]]-POS  is a conservative  [[Republican]]-POS  , and the primary value proposition  [[Trump]]-POS  has offered conservatives is his willingness to appoint conservative judges to the bench.
 [[Trump]]-POS  is almost certainly going to nominate someone who has received a stamp of approval from the party's right wing , and  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators will give that person a thumbs - up.
Where  [[Romney]]-NEG 's announcement went sideways was in its refusal to simply state the obvious point above - that he , as a  [[Republican]]-NEU  , will support a nominee supported by the  [[Republican]]-NEU  establishment.
Instead , like  [[Senate]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  ( R - Ky.
) and a slew of other  [[Republican]]-NEU  elected officials and allies before him ,  [[Romney]]-POS  tried to use historical precedent as a rationale for his support.
 [[Ergo]]-NEG  , this is simply the  [[Republican]]-NEG  - led  [[Senate]]-NEG  taking a position consistent with its 2016 rejection of consideration for a nominee introduced by President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU
But it's a ridiculous argument.
In the two - party era , which essentially began with  [[Abraham Lincoln]]-NEU  in 1861 , there have been only 13 instances in which a  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nomination was made in the same year as a presidential election.
Three of those occurred after the election itself.
The latest any of the others occurred was mid - July.
This is what's known in statistical parlance as a " small sample size.
" A lot of weird patterns can emerge if you do things only a few times.
Flip a coin five times in a row , and you 'd be surprised if it came up heads each time.
But that's going to happen a lot more than if you get heads each time after flipping it 1,000 times.
Even with that small sample size , though ,  [[Romney]]-NEG 's " precedent " requires a " generally , " which is like saying that  [[Denver Broncos]]-NEG  " generally " lose  [[Super Bowl]]-NEU  they play in.
True , but they 've also won  [[Super Bowl]]-POS  three times.
Of the 10 presidential year nominations that occurred before the election itself , eight meet  [[Romney]]-NEU 's same - party standard.
On five occasions ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  held  [[White House]]-POS  and the  [[Senate]]-POS  ; on three ,  [[Republican]]-POS  did.
One important thing to remember here is that the  [[Senate]]-NEU  and  [[White House]]-NEU  are usually controlled by the same party.
In the 80 Congresses since  [[Abraham Lincoln]]-POS  was first elected ,  [[White House]]-NEG  and  [[Senate]]-NEG  have gone into the congressional period under the control of the same party on 56 occasions , 23 times controlled by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and 33 times by  [[Republican]]-NEG
This can and has changed , with retirements , resignations and deaths , but the upshot does n't change : 70 percent of the time , a nominee to the court would pass from a president of one party to a  [[Senate]]-NEU  controlled by the same party.
Romney does n't just focus on the " confirm a nominee of its own party , " though.
He also highlights that nominees from a president of one party are " generally not confirmed " by a  [[Senate]]-NEU  of the other party.
Of the 10 examples listed above , that has happened once : The nomination of  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEU  by  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  in 2016.
In other words , the example that  [[Romney]]-NEG 's deference to precedent is meant to excuse.
In seven of the 10 examples , the nominees were confirmed , four times without even bothering to vote.
The other two examples derive from a weird situation that emerged in 1968 when  [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-NEG  was president.
 [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-NEU  nominated  [[Abe Fortas]]-POS  , a sitting justice ( and longtime ally ) , to become Chief Justice following the announced retirement of  [[Earl Warren]]-NEG
 [[Homer Thornberry]]-POS  was then nominated to fill the seat  [[Abe Fortas]]-NEU  would vacate.
Fortas's nomination , though , hit rocky terrain with accusations of ethical impropriety stemming from speaking fees he had been paid by private businesses.
Fortas withdrew his nomination after barely managing to earn majority support on a cloture vote.
With his elevation to chief justice blocked , the  [[Homer Thornberry]]-NEG  nomination became unnecessary.
All of this happened while  [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-POS 's party had a near - super majority in the  [[Senate]]-NEU
In other words ,  [[Romney]]-NEG 's insistence that history offers guidance demanding a vote on whomever Trump nominates is ridiculous.
History offers little guidance here , as  [[Romney]]-NEG  tacitly admits with his inclusion of that subtle " generally " qualifier.
 [[Romney]]-POS  is a  [[Republican]]-POS  , and , whatever other complaints he might have with the president ,  [[Trump]]-POS  has consistently nominated judges and justices firmly embedded in the  [[Republican]]-NEU  establishment.
It's a historic moment , certainly.
 [[Romney]]-POS  should simply embrace that , instead of using history to rationalize what he's doing .

The  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  swing votes on  [[Günzburg (surname)]]-POS 's replacement.
So what about the key potential  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  votes against the eventual nominee ? What have they said , and what are their political motivations ? Let's recap.
 [[Murkowski]]-NEU  has regularly been a tough vote for the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  , dating back to when she lost her 2010  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  primary but was reelected as a write - in candidate.
But that has especially been the case in the  [[Trump]]-NEU  era , in which  [[Murkowski]]-NEG  has often been one of the potential and actual swing votes , including on the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU 's  [[Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  replacement , which she voted against.
She was also one of the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators who held out for more information from the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  about allegations of a decades - old sexual assault against  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-NEG  during his 2018 confirmation.
She wound up opposing  [[Kavanagh]]-NEG  but voted " present , " she said , to offset a  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  senator who was n't able to make the vote but supported  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS
She has perhaps less obvious political motivations to oppose the nominee here , in that she comes from a red state and could be creating problems for herself in her 2022 reelection bid.
But she has repeatedly held out on similar issues and has criticized President  [[Trump]]-NEG
Collins's calculus is more complicated than  [[Murkowski]]-NEG 's , in that she is up for reelection this year in a very difficult race on that same date.
A  [[Suffolk University]]-POS  poll released Monday showed  [[Democrat]]-NEG  Sarah Gideon leading her 46 percent to 41 percent , and others have shown her deficit as big as double digits.
This may feel like over - parsing , but politicians choose their words carefully for a reason.
And a confirmation after Election Day would be much easier for  [[Collins]]-POS  , who unlike  [[Murkowski]]-NEG  voted for  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  in 2018 and would be freed of immediate electoral concerns come November 4.
The third most - likely holdout would seem to be the  [[Utah]]-NEG  senator , who in February became the only member of a president's party to ever vote to remove them from office following an impeachment trial.
 [[Romney]]-POS  has also staked out principled stands against  [[Trump]]-NEG  on numerous occasions.
And he has recently thrown a wrench in  [[Republican]]-NEU  ' effort to investigate  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  , suggesting it's transparently political.
But to this point , he's been notably quiet about  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  vacancy.
And his office notably shot down an Internet rumor that he would not confirm a nominee until after Inauguration Day.
That does n't mean  [[Romney]]-NEU  will be on board , necessarily.
But his lack of comment is notable and suggests he's keeping his powder dry.
As with  [[Murkowski]]-NEG  , the political motivation is less evident , given that  [[Romney]]-NEG  comes from a red state ( albeit one that , thanks to its heavy  [[Mormons]]-NEU  population , has resisted Trump more than other similar states )
 [[Romney]]-POS  has also shown that he's willing to take principled positions against  [[Trump]]-NEG  that might hurt him in his state and with the broader Republican Party.
But one key difference with the two female  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators above is this : They are more moderate on abortion rights , and opposing a potential  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominee who might vote against [[Roe v.
Wade]] on procedural grounds could make their eventual vote on such a pivotal nominee simpler.
To the extent  [[Collins]]-NEU  and  [[Murkowski]]-NEU  have come out against this looming nomination , they 've increased pressure on  [[Romney]]-NEG  as a potential swing vote - one that could potentially push this to a 50 - 50 vote.
 [[Grassley]]-POS  ( R - Iowa ) has been pretty clear about his concern about proceeding with a nominee in a presidential election year.
In his previous role as  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  chairman , he had more control over that.
But he's still a vote that , if the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  lost him , would probably torpedo the nominee.
" If I were chairman of the committee and this vacancy occurred , I would not have a hearing on it because that's what I promised the people in 2016 , "  [[Grassley]]-POS  said in July.
That's not to say he would be expected to oppose whomever that nominee is.
But given that retiring Senator  [[Lamar Alexander]]-NEG  ( R - Tenn.
) has given this gambit the go - ahead ,  [[Grassley]]-NEG  is perhaps the one  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  graybeard who could potentially oppose this on procedural and institutional grounds.
 [[Grassley]]-NEU  is reportedly set to issue a statement Monday.
One probably should n't hold one's breath , though.
Update :  [[Grassley]]-POS  in a statement ignored his previous comments on not taking up the nomination , saying he 'll evaluate the nominee on their merits and attacking  [[Democrat]]-NEG  for how they 've handled previous nominations.
The  [[Colorado]]-NEG    [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  senator , like [[Collins]] , faces a difficult reelection bid this year , with most recent polls showing him trailing by statistically significant margins.
Unlike others in somewhat - less - tough races , though ( including  [[Iowa]]-NEU 's  [[Joni Ernst]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU   [[Thom Tillis]] ) , he has yet to give the go - ahead to pressing forward.
His statement Friday night only dealt with his condolences on  [[Günzburg (surname)]]-NEG 's death and her stature in  [[American]]-NEU  history.
To the extent  [[Gardner]]-NEG  is trying to make a comeback in his reelection bid , voting against a nominee might make sense to give him some moderate cred.
But the pressure to fall in with one's party is often immense , and you have to wonder if he 'd ever ultimately ever be a decisive vote - especially given his lack of comment thus far.
Update :  [[Gardner]]-POS  also says he 'll judge the nominee on their merits , without raising a procedural objection .

Disrupting Western family structure no longer among  [[BLM]]-NEG 's stated goals as manifesto vanishes from website ahead of  [[United States]]-NEG  election.
The Black Lives Matter activism group has deleted a page called " What We Believe " from its website , disappearing such objectives as disrupting the " Western - prescribed nuclear family structure " as the November 3 election nears.
The manifesto was published on BLM's " What We Believe " page at least as long ago as on February 2 but was no longer available as of last Friday.
The page is now blank , except for an error message indicating that it ca n't be found.
BLM gave no explanation for its missing manifesto ; nor did it offer a comparable replacement , forcing all those curious about the movement's goals to go to an " about " page , which , in rather general terms , explains its mission to eradicate white supremacy and " intervene in violence inflicted on black communities.
" It does not , however , include a belief , featured in the original manifesto , that " the nuclear family structure " should be consigned to the dustbin of history.
" We disrupt the  [[Western]]-NEU  - prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another , especially our children , to the degree that mothers , parents and children are comfortable , " the now - vanished - without - a - trace manifesto stated.
Whether  [[BLM]]-NEG  made an unlikely turnaround , or concluded that now is not a good time for a list of its core beliefs to be made readily available to anyone with a Web connection , is up for speculation.
BLM enjoyed strong public support when a wave of anti - racism protests across the nation began following the May 25 death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU  police custody , but its popularity has faded as initially peaceful protests against police brutality descended into riots , arson and outright violence.
A Politico - Morning Consult poll published earlier this month showed that 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of  [[BLM]]-POS  , down from 61 percent in June.
Coincidentally , the page disappeared at just about the same time as  [[The New York Times]]-NEG  quietly changed the introduction for its controversial 1619 Project , a revisionist tale of  [[United States]]-NEG  history that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  decried as an  [[Anti-Americanism]]-NEG  , " twisted web of lies.
" Without posting a correction or clarification , the  [[The New York Times]]-POS  removed the central claim and namesake point of the project - the assertion that  [[United States]]-NEU 's true founding was in 1619 , not 1776 .

 [[CDC]]-POS  publishes , then DELETES , new guidelines warning of aerosol Covid-19 transmission , contradicting WHO.
 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEG  has added to the confusion about coronavirus , updating then deleting new guidelines about its spread that differ from the official position of  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU
" It is possible that Covid19 may spread through the droplets and airborne particles that are formed when a person who has Covid-19 coughs , sneezes , sings , talks , or breathes.
There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others , and travel distances beyond 6 feet ( for example , during choir practice , in restaurants , or in fitness classes )
In general , indoor environments without good ventilation increase this risk , " the  [[CDC]]-POS  said on its website on Friday , according to an archived copy.
The current version of the same page does not contain that passage.
Instead , there is a note that " a draft version of proposed changes to these recommendations was posted in error " and that new recommendations on airborne transmission are pending.
The  [[CDC]]-NEG 's original update flew below the radar over the weekend , drowned out by the news about Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEU  passing and the ensuing political drama.
On Sunday it was noticed and reported by  [[CNN]]-POS  , while on Monday  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  reported that the  [[CDC]]-POS  seemed to be coming around to the position advocated by " independent experts " for months - that aerosol transmission of Covid-19 was a thing and that indoor ventilation was key to protecting against it.
That was certainly news to  [[World Health Organization]]-NEG  , whose official position - enforced with draconian glee by social media platforms - does not mention aerosol transmission , and sets the preferred social distance at three feet ( 0.9 meters ) rather than the  [[CDC]]-NEU 's six.
" Certainly we have n't seen any new evidence and our position on this remains the same , "  [[Michael Ryan]]-POS  , director of the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU 's emergencies program , told reporters Monday at a press conference , adding he will be reaching out to the  [[CDC]]-NEU  for clarification.
Last week , the  [[CDC]]-NEG  publicly flip - flopped on testing guidance , abandoning its August recommendation that only people with symptoms , vulnerable persons and frontline workers should be getting tested.
The guidelines were condemned by lockdown - happy governors who vowed to ignore them.
As of Friday , the  [[CDC]]-POS  once again says people showing no symptoms who spent more than 15 minutes within six feet of someone who tested positive for Covid-19 , should get tested.
Earlier in the week ,  [[CDC]]-POS  Director  [[Robert Redfield]]-POS  told  [[Congress]]-POS  that face masks were " more guaranteed to protect " against the virus than the vaccine , which he said would n't be available until late in 2021.
This was directly contradicted by President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and Dr.
 [[Scott Atlas]]-NEU  , from the  [[White House]]-NEU  coronavirus task force , on Friday.
They told reporters they expected enough doses for every  [[American]]-NEU  by April at the latest.
The  [[CDC]]-NEG 's flip - flopping follows the sudden departure of  [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-NEU  spokesman  [[Michael Caputo]]-NEG  , who had accused " seditious " personnel there of running an " anti - Trump resistance unit , " before announcing he would be taking a 60-day medical leave of absence .

Come to Vote , Stay for the Art.
While many  [[California]]-NEU  museums are still shuttered because of the coronavirus , and others are opening slowly at limited capacity , the Institute of Contemporary Art San José has come up with an ingenious solution to open the museum , legally , for four days.
Starting on October 31 through Election Day , the museum will become a polling site.
Alison Gass , its executive director , is hoping that civic - minded citizens will stream through the museum to vote and take time to appreciate the art inside ( a local art exhibition called " Personal Alchemy " ) and out.
It will be hard not to notice.
A 50-foot vinyl mural by the  [[Iranian]]-POS  - born artist  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS  will wrap around the museum's facade , and two six - foot circular paintings of his will slowly rotate in two windows.
In his mural , titled "  [[Remember This]]-POS  , " messages in vibrant colors read : " REMEMBER MY CHILD NOWHERE IS  [[SAFE]]-NEU  " ; " THEY WILL SMILE TO YOUR FACE " ; and " A BORDERLESS WORLD , " along with other text.
By " child , " Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS  means his younger self - by the age of 6 , he had lived in four countries (  [[Iran]]-NEU  ,  [[Italy]]-NEU  ,  [[Turkey]]-NEU  and  [[United States]]-NEU  ) - and his 5-year - old son.
" In  [[United States]]-NEG  , people have a false sense of security , " he said in a recent interview.
In late July , Ms Gass , who also is the museum's chief curator , asked Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS  to paint a mural that addressed " the social and political conditions happening in this election and beyond.
" He told her that was what he was thinking about , too.
His paintings would appear outside of the institute , " because we wanted a safe way for people to see art , " Ms Gass said.
A few days later , she met with her longtime collaborator , Florie Hutchinson , who was about to become the museum's director of external relations.
Ms Hutchinson thought of a way for more people to see Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS 's art : Make the institute a polling place.
 [[Santa Clara County, California]]-NEU  , of which  [[San José]]-POS  is the county seat , will be using libraries , empty schools , City Hall Council chambers , another museum and even a police department , said Paulo Chang , the county registrar of voters , election division coordinator.
Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS  said his paintings for the museum are self - portraits with imagery from disparate cultures that express injustices all over the world.
" This is a pretty political mural , but it does n't say to vote one way or another , " he added.
An  [[American]]-NEU  citizen , Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-NEG  , 41 , who lives in  [[Los Angeles]]-NEG  , said he has experienced what he calls the abuse of government power firsthand.
In January 2017 , when President  [[Trump]]-NEG  closed the nation's borders to refugees and suspended immigration from several predominantly  [[Muslims]]-NEU  countries , he was detained " in a basement room at Newark Airport with other brown people , " almost all of whom were citizens , he said.
He said his passport was taken from him.
Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS 's paintings reflect his fears that " the world is getting darker and darker , " he said.
His concerns include but are not limited to " the environment , the treatment of children by  [[Ice (disambiguation)]]-NEG  , racism , social injustice , an almost war with  [[Iran]]-NEG  for no reason , " he said.
Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS  is also designing a giveaway button that says : " Vote like your life depends on it.
" That message will be on signs in city bus shelters and on streetlight poles.
" We were poised to be nimble , especially in a moment of unimaginable crisis for arts organizations , " Ms Gass said.
The institute , which used to be called  [[San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art]]-POS  but was recently renamed , occupies a red brick , one - story building in downtown  [[San José]]-NEU  , the third - largest city in  [[California]]-NEU  , which  [[Sam Liccardo]]-POS  , its mayor , has called " a city of immigrants.
" As of 2014 , 38 percent of residents were immigrants , including an  [[Iranian]]-NEU  community.
The institute , which is celebrating its 40th year , usually sees 30,000 visitors annually and has a $ 1.5 million budget.
It received some assistance from  [[Paycheck Protection Program]]-POS  and has kept all seven employees.
At the end of July , Ms Gass , the former director of  [[University of Chicago]]-NEU    [[Smart Museum of Art]]-NEU  , was sitting on a curb in [[Palo Alto, California]] , sipping ice coffee with Ms Hutchinson.
They wanted Mr  [[Amir H Fallah]]-POS 's art to be seen by as many people as possible during " this most important election of our lifetime , " Ms Hutchinson said.
Ms Hutchinson was familiar with the California Voter's Choice Act , which is designed to make voting more convenient.
It decouples voting from neighborhoods by offering " vote centers , " larger venues near parking and transit hubs.
Voters can choose any center countywide.
His painting is 16 feet by 3 feet.
Through the use of high - resolution photography , it has been enlarged and printed on vinyl as a mural.
It and the two circular paintings are mash - ups : Ancient script is set against skateboarders ' graffiti ,  [[Persian]]-NEU  miniature horses against the Black Panthers logo.
The circular paintings represent  [[Earth]]-NEU  and are edged with " the chaotic mesh of plant life , " he said.
One is called "  [[Cowboy]]-POS  , " the other "  [[Cowboy]]-POS  , " inspired by vintage Valentines.
Mixed in are images of a  [[Cambodian]]-NEG  propaganda figure , mythical figures from old match boxes , " debris of life " that he finds online.
When the paintings rotate , plants and cultures will tumble onto one another.
Explanatory text will appear in five languages , including  [[Spanish]]-NEU  ,  [[Mandarin]]-NEU  ,  [[Vietnamese]]-NEU  and  [[Persian language]]-POS  .

The Green Party's biggest fan ? In some states , it's the GO.P.
Four years ago ,  [[Green Party]]-POS  candidate played a significant role in several crucial battleground states , drawing a vote total in three of them -  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  - that exceeded the margin between  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU
This year ,  [[Republican Party]]-POS  has been trying to use  [[Green Party]]-POS  to its advantage again , if not always successfully.
In  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , a GO.P.
elections commissioner and lawyers with ties to  [[Republican]]-NEU  tried to aid attempts by  [[Howie Hawkins]]-POS  ,  [[Green Party]]-NEU  presidential candidate , to get on the ballot there , which were ultimately unsuccessful.
In  [[Montana]]-POS  , state regulators found that  [[Republican Party]]-NEG  had violated campaign finance laws as part of an effort to help the  [[Greens]]-NEU  in five down - ballot races , including for senator and governor.
And in  [[Western Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , petitioners from  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[California]]-NEU  were brought in to gather signatures for Mr  [[Howie Hawkins]]-NEG  by an outside firm whose actions Mr  [[Howie Hawkins]]-NEG  and the party said they could not account for.
Mr  [[Howie Hawkins]]-NEG  also did not make the ballot there.
With Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  trailing Joseph R Biden Jr in most national and swing - state polls ,  [[Republican]]-POS  are again trying to help third parties that may appeal to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters and siphon off votes from Mr Biden.
This is taking place alongside a broader pattern of disinformation and skepticism by the president and his allies that has sown confusion and undermined confidence in the election.
Supporters of the president have also been trying to advance the candidacy of  [[Kanye West]]-POS  , the billionaire hip - hop artist , confident that he can cut into Mr Biden's vote total.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have portrayed the effort as a " dirty trick " and exploitative of Mr  [[West]]-NEG  , who has bipolar disorder .

 [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-NEG  , Whose Father  [[Death]]-NEG  of  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  , Denounces Trump at DN.C.
The opening hour of the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' all - virtual convention featured several nationally recognized politicians addressing topics like systemic racism , police violence and economic recovery.
But some of the most striking comments came from a woman few  [[Americans]]-NEU  may have heard of before Monday.
The reason , she asserted , was President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
Ms  [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-POS  garnered attention this year when she wrote an obituary published in  [[The Arizona Republic]]-POS  in which she laid blame for her father's death at the feet of state and federal leaders and their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Monday , she walked through her thinking for a national television audience , saying that her father had voted for Mr  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , had " had faith " in him , and had believed it would be OK to go to a karaoke bar soon after  [[Arizona]]-NEU 's stay - at - home order had been lifted.
"  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  may not have caused the coronavirus , but his dishonesty and his irresponsible actions made it so much worse , " she said.
Ms  [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-POS 's message will be underscored in an advertisement set to be released Tuesday by the Nuestro PAC , a super PAC led by former aides to Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  that is focusing on turning out Latino voters.
The ad will air in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-POS  to start.
 [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-NEG  Urquiza : Hi.
I 'm  [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-POS
I 'm one of the many who have lost a loved one to  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG
My dad , Mark Anthony Urquiza , should be here today , but he is n't.
He had faith in  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
He voted for him , listened to him , believed him and his mouthpieces when they said that coronavirus was under control and going to disappear , that it was OK to end social distancing rules before it was safe , and that if you had no underlying health conditions you 'd probably be fine.
So in late May , after the stay - at - home order was lifted in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , my dad went to a karaoke bar with his friends.
A few weeks later he was on a ventilator , and after five days he died alone , in the  [[Intensive care unit]]-NEU  , with a nurse holding his hand.
My dad was a healthy 65-year - old.
His only pre - existing condition was trusting  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  - and for that he paid with his life.
I am not alone.
Once I told my story , a lot of people reached out to me to share theirs.
They asked me to help keep the community safe , especially communities of color , which have been disproportionately affected.
They asked me , a normal person , to help , because  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  wo n't.
The coronavirus has made it clear that there are two  [[Americas]]-NEU  :  [[United States]]-NEU  that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  lives in and the  [[United States]]-NEG  that my father died in.
Enough is enough.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  may not have caused the coronavirus , but his dishonesty and his irresponsible actions made it so much worse.
We need a leader who has a national , coordinated , data - driven response to stop the pandemic from claiming more lives and safely reopen the country.
We need a leader who will step in on day one and do his job : to care.
One of the last things that my father said to me was that he felt betrayed by the likes of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
And so when I cast my vote for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , I will do it for my dad.

Most  [[Americans]]-NEU  understand that we probably wo n't see a winner on election night.
Or , perhaps , things wo n't be that bad after all.
A national poll from  [[Quinnipiac University]]-POS  published Wednesday afternoon presented new data on how  [[Americans]]-NEU  plan to vote and when they expect to learn the result.
As has consistently been the case in  [[Quinnipiac]]-POS 's polling this year , former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  holds a national lead over President  [[Trump]]-POS  , with members of each party broadly supporting their party's candidate.
The  [[Quinnipiac]]-POS  poll also mirrors other polling in measuring how people plan to vote.
About half say they 'll vote in person on Election Day ; 6 in 10 say they 'll vote in person either on or before the election.
A third plan to vote by mail or absentee ballot.
There's an obvious partisan split there , with about half of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  planning to vote by mail and more than half of  [[Republican]]-NEU  planning to vote in person.
Quinnipiac's results offer a stark example of how that will affect the vote - counting : Those planning to vote in person on Election Day prefer Trump by 22 points , while those planning to vote by mail prefer  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  by 42 points.
In other words ,  [[Trump]]-POS  may end the evening November 3 with a lead , thanks to those in - person votes.
But as the absentee votes are counted , that lead may fade , leading to a broad  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  win.
Again :  [[Quinnipiac]]-POS  has  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  winning by 10 points overall , even if votes cast on Election Day have him down by more than 20.
This is why things could get problematic.
While this is one poll and does n't include consideration of absentee or early votes counted before or on Election Day itself ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  will almost certainly declare that the results tallied that day should stand , as he has in the past.
It will be incumbent , then , that the public broadly understand that the results counted at that point are n't necessarily reflective of the eventual outcome.
The good news is that most people do.
Only about 3 in 10  [[Americans]]-NEU  think we 'll know who won the election on November 3 itself.
The large majority say we wo n't - including  [[Democrat]]-POS  and  [[Republican]]-POS  in equal measure.
There's another bit of good news from  [[Quinnipiac]]-POS 's poll that might suggest a less contentious post - election period.
Asked how upset they would be if their preferred candidate did n't win ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  were more likely than  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to say they would only be somewhat upset.
Among stated supporters of Biden and Trump , Biden supporters were much more likely to say they would be very upset.
Only 56 percent of  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters held that position.
This can certainly change , particularly after a close race drenched with vituperative rhetoric.
But it does serve as a potent reminder that  [[Trump]]-NEG 's interest in prolonging the fight to preserve his power is almost certainly not shared as fervently among others , including  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters.
Of course it does n't take many people committed to  [[Trump]]-NEG 's position - or many opposed to the incumbent - to make the aftermath of the election uncomfortable.
That most  [[Americans]]-NEU  already understand that there will be a need for patience to determine who won the presidential contest , though , is clearly better than the alternative .

 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  defends DHS at hearing , calling whistleblower's claims ' patently false '
Former chief of intelligence at the  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  ,  [[Brian Murphy]]-NEG  , filed a whistleblower complaint describing repeated instances in which he claims the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration sought to " censor or manipulate " intelligence for political purposes , including information about  [[Russian]]-NEG  efforts to interfere in the 2020 elections.
The document , a copy of which was obtained by  [[ABC News]]-NEG  , alleges a pattern of behavior ranging from " attempted abuse of authority " to possible violations of federal law perpetrated by some of the administration's senior - most law enforcement and intelligence officials.
Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  speaks during an event at DHS headquarters in  [[Washington]]-POS  , September 9 , 2020.
Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  speaks during an event at DHS headquarters in  [[Washington]]-NEU  , September 9 , 2020.President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  formally nominated  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  for the secretary job in August , but he has been serving as the acting secretary since November.
If confirmed by the  [[Senate]]-POS  ,  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  would be the first confirmed  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-POS  Secretary in over a year.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  was also adamant on Wednesday that he did not withhold an intelligence report on disinformation on former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's mental health.
 [[ABC News]]-POS  previously reported that DHS withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a  [[Russian]]-NEG  scheme to promote " allegations about the poor mental health " of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  , asked specifically if he considers  [[Russia]]-POS  to be advancing propaganda against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , said there are three countries are a concern.
" On everything that I 've seen that there are three nation states that we have to be very concerned about one is  [[Russia]]-NEG  , one is  [[China]]-NEG  , and one is  [[Iran]]-NEG  and they all have different ways in different motivations of doing this , " he said.

 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  , Secretary of Homeland Security , sits in the audience during the 2020 Republican National Convention on the South Lawn of the White House , Aug 27 , 2020 , in  [[Washington]]-NEU  , DC.On immigration ,  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  has been a loyal supporter of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's agenda even as [[U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] , which falls under DHS , faces continued scrutiny over medical care in civil detention facilities.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  on the House Homeland Security committee announced last week the start of a new investigation into allegations from a detention facility nurse , including reports that ICE detainees in  [[Irwin County Detention Center]]-NEG  were subjected to hysterectomy operations without their full understanding or consent.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  said he looks forward to this review.
 [[ABC News]]-NEG  has not independently confirmed the allegations.
A new report from  [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security]]-POS  found that officials used the threat of isolated confinement in order to maintain control over detainees at the River Correctional Center in  [[Louisiana]]-NEG  and Otero County Processing Center in  [[New Mexico]]-NEG
Detainees who had submitted repeated medical requests or engaged in hunger strikes were segregated as a form of discipline , according to the report.
The findings suggest that officials at three facilities ignored mental health warnings from detainees by minimizing some suicide red flags despite evidence of self harm.
Evidence of suicide attempts at  [[Otero]]-NEG  ,  [[River]]-NEG  , and the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in  [[Louisiana]]-NEG  were written off as not " serious , " according to the report.

 [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  and the department's number two ,  [[Ken Cuccinelli]]-NEG  , have also been in the hot seat after  [[Government Accountability Office]]-NEU  found they were unlawfully appointed to their current roles.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  said that he disagrees with the logic used by the  [[Government Accountability Office]]-NEG  and said its decision is non binding.
The DHS Inspector General declined to take action against the two leaders.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG 's profile rose earlier this summer when he sent federal agents -- against the wishes of  [[Oregon]]-NEU  Gov.
 [[Kate Brown]]-NEG  and  [[Portland]]-NEG  Mayor  [[Ted Wheeler]]-NEG  -- to quell violence occurring outside the federal courthouse in  [[Portland]]-NEG  ,  [[Oregon]]-NEG  , during protests over police brutality and racial injustice.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU  has largely defended the department's actions .

Ivanka , Pence bring law - and - order tour to city of Floyd.
MINNEAPOLIS -- Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  and  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  are bringing President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's law - and - order campaign message to  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU  on Thursday , showing support for law enforcement in the city where  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  death sparked angry and sometimes violent protests that spread around the world.
The visit comes about a month after  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  met with small - business owners whose stores in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEG  were damaged in violence that erupted after  [[George Floyd]]-NEG 's death.
Trump did not visit the scene of protests nor the site where police held  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  down as they tried to arrest him for allegedly passing a counterfeit $ 20 bill at a convenience store ; the schedule for Thursday does n't include those places either.
The visit also will be a day after a  [[Kentucky]]-NEU  grand jury weighing charges in  [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor]]-NEG  death indicted a single former police officer on charges of shooting into neighboring apartments , but chose not to indict any officers directly in her death.
Trump is eager to put  [[Minnesota]]-POS  in play four years after he narrowly lost the state to  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  , with a strategy that depends largely on driving up turnout in the rural areas where he runs strongest.
For some in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEG  , the campaign's law - and - order message is calculated , divisive and damaging.
" Hate and fear are good for getting votes , but it's not good for governing , " said Paul Eaves , a  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU  resident who regularly tends to artwork and flowers at the intersection that has become a memorial to  [[George Floyd]]-NEG
 [[George Floyd]]-NEG  died after a white police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed Black man's neck on May 25 during an arrest attempt that was captured on bystander video.
His death set off protests around the world , including some that became violent.
Property damage in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEG  is estimated at roughly $ 100 million.
After  [[George Floyd]]-NEG 's death , a majority of  [[City council]]-NEU  members pledged to abolish  [[Police]]-NEU  and replace it with a new agency that would take a more socially minded approach.
Their hopes of taking the idea to voters in November was blocked by a city commission and wo n't happen before 2021 , if ever.
The talk of abolishing police came as  [[Minneapolis]]-NEG  this summer saw spiking violent crime , as many other big cities did , and as some residents complained that police response times had slowed.
Some of the same council members who supported ending the department pressed Police Chief  [[Medaria Arradondo]]-POS  last week to address the rising crime.
Police union President  [[Bob Kroll]]-NEG  did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story.
He has complained that city leaders have abandoned rank - and - file officers.
Roughly 175 officers are seeking work - related disability , according to an attorney helping file the claims , with post - traumatic stress disorder being cited as a main reason for most departures.
A  [[Star Tribune]]-POS  analysis found that as of last week , violent crimes such as homicide , rape , robbery and aggravated assaults were up 17 % from the five - year average.
Serious assaults , including shootings and stabbings , were up 25 %
Belal Hijazi , owner of the Full Stop gas station in north  [[Minneapolis]]-NEG  , spent a night protecting his business while others around him burned during the height of the unrest that followed  [[George Floyd]]-NEG 's death.
Since then , he said , he's seen people taking advantage of a reduced police presence to more freely deal drugs , loiter and shoplift around his station.
Jeanelle Austin , 35 , a racial justice leadership coach , has emerged as a lead caretaker of the George Floyd Memorial.
Austin , who is  [[Black]]-POS  , said  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS 's law - and - order message is code for increased law enforcement aiming to " make white people feel safe , but it is a direct threat to Black and brown communities , " she said.
Rozenia Fuller , a pastor at Good News Baptist Church in  [[Minneapolis]]-POS  , called the visit from Pence and  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  a " good idea " because she said interaction can change how the current social justice movement is perceived and further its goals.

Debate coach Brett O'Donnell   reviews what could trip Trump up during debate with Biden.
Fox News Flash top headlines are here.
Check out what's clicking on  [[Fox News]]-POS
Brett O'Donnell ,   a top  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  political debate coach , said Wednesday that President  [[Trump]]-POS  should be vigilant in his upcoming debate with  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , by steering clear of certain issues which might tank his  [[White House]]-NEU  reelection chances.
O'Donnell said  [[Trump]]-POS  should also focus on the success   being seen in the   economy   by way of promising jobs numbers and a stabilized stock market , despite the COVID-19 pandemic and recent unrest   in major cities.
" That is one of his greatest arguments for why he should be reelected and it happens to be the thing that we 'll look at as the most important issue to vote on in an election , " he said.
" Trump   has to defend what they 've done on the economy.
What could derail him is if he gets hung up on either side issues that folks do n't really care about , or defending specific actions during the pandemic.
When asked if  [[Trump]]-POS    will -- or should -- go after  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's mental faculties , O'Donnell said he expects the president to address the issue but does n't think he will go into specifics.
Due to his long tenure in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  and his service as vice president under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  , O'Donnell claimed  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  will have a hard time dealing with  [[Trump]]-NEG 's attacks if the commander - in - chief is able to stay on message.

Wealth tax is almost impossible , says billionaire  [[Jamie Dimon]]-POS
Calculating wealth can be " extremely complicated , " according to  [[JPMorgan Chase]]-POS  CEO  [[Jamie Dimon]]-POS  , who says the rich should be taxed on their income which is " given " and harder to cheat.
" A wealth tax is almost impossible to do , "  [[Jamie Dimon]]-POS  told  [[CNBC]]-NEU  - TV18 at the JPMorgan  [[India]]-NEU  summit on Tuesday when he was asked whether he's in favor of such a proposal put forth by several  [[United States]]-NEU   [[Democrat]]
" I 'm not against having higher tax on the wealthy.
But I think that you do that through their income as opposed to , you know , calculate wealth which becomes extremely complicated , legalistic , bureaucratic , regulatory , and people find a million ways around it.
I would just tax income , " he said.
Dimon , 64 , who has a reported net worth of $ 1.3 billion and makes $ 31.5 million per year , says he has " no problem " paying higher taxes on his salary , as long as the government spends that money wisely.
A study published last year by the Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development found that the    [[United States]]-NEG  lost more tax revenue   than any other developed country in 2018 , largely due to  [[United States]]-NEG  President    [[Donald Trump]]-NEG    tax cuts .

There were no reports of injuries or    damage to the plane in the collision.

 [[Justice minister]]-POS
Discloses Pa.
Ballot Inquiry , Prompting Fears of Politicization.
 [[Justin Levitt]]-POS  , a former  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  official , said on  [[Twitter]]-POS  that the investigation itself could be legitimate but denounced the disclosure of details about it , including the candidate's identity.
The announcement itself was also unusual ; Mr  [[Freed]]-NEG 's office deleted the news release from its website , positing a revised version.
The original statement said all nine of the ballots had been cast for Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  , and the revised version said seven ballots were cast for the president and two remained in their envelopes.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  has made false claims about fraudulent voting a central message in his re - election campaign.
The disclosure on Thursday provided the president and his allies with a new angle to attack mail - in voting : a conspiracy against his own voters.
Around the time Mr  [[Freed]]-NEU  released the statement ,  [[White House]]-NEU  and Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU 's campaign cited the investigation in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  as an example of the problems with mail - in voting.
Attorney General  [[William Barr]]-NEG  has also been outspoken in his criticism of mail - in voting , repeating the president's false claims that such ballots are rife with potential for fraud.
He has also falsely stated that " there's no secret ballot " in voting by mail.
His criticisms , coupled with the rhetoric from Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU  and his allies , have unnerved  [[Democrat]]-NEU  who fear that the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration could seek to undermine or even disrupt the election in November.
The FB.I.
director ,  [[Christopher A Wray]]-NEG  , undercut that rhetoric on Thursday , telling lawmakers that the bureau had not uncovered a " coordinated national voter fraud effort.
" He said that it would be a " major challenge for an adversary " to pull off a large - scale voter fraud operation that could affect election results .

How three decades of partisan fighting and hypocrisy enabled Trump to reshape the federal judiciary.
Over the past three years , the  [[Senate]]-POS  has confirmed more than 200  [[Trump]]-NEU  judicial nominees.
One in every four circuit court judges is now a  [[Trump]]-POS  appointee.
Each of  [[Trump]]-NEU 's  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominees have been confirmed with only a simple majority needed to end any potential filibuster.
Now ,  [[Republican]]-NEG  and  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are accusing each other of hypocrisy.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  who called for filling the vacancy created by the death of Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG  in 2016 are now calling for it to be held open , and  [[Republican]]-NEG  who called for holding open the vacancy in 2016 are now calling for it to be filled.
The Fix drew upon hours of archival footage and interviews with  [[Post]]-POS  reporters to analyze the history of  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  nominating battles and how they could impact the high court for years to come .

Six - month mark : Border families face headaches , heartache over US.-Mexico border restrictions.
Blanca Escalante spends much of her   time taking care of seniors , crisscrossing between work and family obligations on both sides of the US.-Mexico border ,  [[El Paso Times]]-NEU  , a USA TODAY Network publication , reports.
The 53-year - old works weeknights   assisting an elderly couple in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  , where she lives as a legal permanent resident.
On weekends , she helps her sister in  [[Juárez]]-NEU  care for their 84-year - old mother   - a commitment that has become increasingly onerous as travel restrictions at the border head into a seventh month.
" My mother and sister have a tourist visa and ca n't cross , " Escalante said.
" So I 'm the one that has to go there.
As family and financial obligations mount for those whose lives bridge the US.-Mexico divide , so does the pressure   to cross the border   - even at the risk of unpredictable lines , record - long wait times and rapidly shifting border policies that some worry could leave them trapped on one side or the other.
The added misery   on the border could endure until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available , not expected   until after mid-2021.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  first restricted travel at the US.-Mexico border March 21 to slow the spread of COVID-19 , limiting   crossings to  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens and permanent residents for " essential " visits only , for work ,   school or health care.
The   partial closure has divided the lives of  [[Borderland]]-NEU  families   in ways few could have imagined before the pandemic.
The sort of family visit Escalante makes does n't fall into the  [[United States]]-NEU  government's category of " essential " travel , but she says her responsibilities weigh heavily.
Some trips across the border are worth the riskEscalante and thousands of others continue to cross despite the   anxiety and helplessness.
A pesar del coraje   - despite the fury - they feel at not knowing whether their commute home might be the equivalent of the 40 minutes from  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  to Las Cruces or five hours to  [[Lubbock, Texas]]-NEU
Leonardo Escobosa ,   a 22-year - old economics graduate of   the University of Texas at  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  , fell in love a year ago with Yailin Espinoza , 23 , who lives in  [[Juárez]]-POS
They spent five months of the pandemic apart , hoping the government would loosen the restrictions.
Finally , in August , Escobosa decided to risk crossing.
He surprised Espinoza by arriving earlier than she expected   at her mother's house ,   with flowers.
More than once , 25-year - old Grecia Luna arrived late to work at an  [[El Paso Times]]-NEU  coffee shop after the restrictions made bridge wait times less predictable.
The dual citizen found independence working on the  [[United States]]-NEU  side of the border   while living with roommates in  [[Juárez]]-NEU  , where she grew up.
The coffee shop ,  [[Fahrenheit]]-NEG  , did n't survive the pandemic and she lost her job.
If there is a measure of   how intertwined lives are in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  and  [[Juárez]]-NEU    and other border communities , it may be this : After [[U.S.
Customs and Border Protection]] intensified the crackdown on " non - essential " crossings in August , wait times skyrocketed to six , seven or eight hours.
And crossings barely budged , according to  [[CBP]]-POS
August crossing data is n't yet available.
But personal vehicle crossings at  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  international bridges dropped hard after the restrictions were put in place , to fewer than 400,000 crossings in April from a monthly average between 900,000 to 1.2 million , according to the Borderplex Business Barometer , a monthly analysis produced by  [[University of Texas at El Paso]]-POS  researchers.
By June , the latest month for which data is available , they were up to 550,000.
Rep.
 [[Veronica Escobar]]-POS  ( D - El Paso ) said she has been advocating for a binational testing strategy that would allow border communities to co - exist safely.
The weekend of the crackdown , Escalante endured an eight - hour bridge line overnight , with her daughter at the wheel.
Escobosa spent Saturday with his girlfriend , then six hours on Sunday   locked in his car , inching north toward the international line.
' We thought it would be temporary'On the second - to - last Friday in March ,  [[Downtown El Paso]]-NEG  was   breezy ,   cool and uncharacteristically empty.
The city's stay - at - home order was still four days off.
But that morning ,    [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  announced that it would restrict travel at the US.-Mexico border , starting at midnight.
Overnight , the borderline   - long regarded in border communities as little more than a threshold to home   - suddenly hardened.
There was widespread confusion for days about whether  [[Mexico]]-NEG  had closed its border to  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens ( it had n't ) or whether  [[Juárez]]-NEU  residents with a tourist card could cross to the  [[United States]]-NEU  for " essential " reasons   ( they could n't )
The young couple , Escobosa and Espinoza , remained hopeful.
" Time would go by and we would still hope to see each other next month , " Espinoza said.
In practice , six months on , the restrictions still bar most  [[Mexican]]-NEU  nationals from crossing the land border , including those who hold a tourist visa , while  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens and   permanent residents face increased scrutiny by CBP at ports of entry.
But the restrictions did n't end there.
Since the pandemic began , the   Trump administration has floated or taken additional measures to curb movement at the US.-Mexico border , using the contagion to justify   reducing legal cross - border flows.
In July , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration threatened to bar   international students from living in the  [[United States]]-NEU  while   taking fall classes online , a policy it rescinded after facing a rash of lawsuits by universities.
The University of Texas at  [[El Paso Times]]-NEU  vowed to defend its students ' ability to stay in the  [[United States]]-NEU    - but fear kept many from daring to go home to  [[Mexico]]-NEU  or other countries.
Then , in mid - August , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration drafted a proposal that could have blocked  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens and permanent residents from returning to the  [[United States]]-NEU  at the  [[Mexican]]-NEU  border.
That proposal , on dubious legal footing ,   never left the draft stage.
But 10 days later , [[U.S.
Customs and Border Protection]] announced it would crack down on non - essential travel at ports of entry at the US.-Mexico border.
In  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  ,  [[CBP]]-NEG  closed all but two lanes at three major international bridges on a weekend , catching many unawares and provoking   wait times that ballooned to six , seven and eight hours.
Escalante said the changes - both threatened and real - make her nervous.
She is n't crossing as often as she used to , she said.
She wo n't go to  [[Juárez]]-NEU  during weekdays for fear of missing work ; but , in her experience since the crackdown , weekends are when the wait times are worst.
Escobosa has resorted to logistical gymnastics to make his relationship work.
He plans for the uncertainty , he said   - keeps the gas tank full ,   checks the oil in his car , thinks hours ahead about what awaits him.
Luna , looking for a new job in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  despite the complications , does n't know what to make of the future.
No relief in sightAs the pandemic wears on , the   " temporary " restrictions are renewed like clockwork.
Each month  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-POS  extends them another month.
The restrictions   currently run through October 21.
In  [[El Paso, Texas]]-POS  , Mayor  [[Dee Margo]]-POS  said he recognizes the toll the restrictions are taking on  [[Borderland]]-NEU  residents and the city's businesses , especially Downtown.
He said he has advocated for reducing wait times at the border but favors holding the restrictions in place until both sides have the pandemic under better control.
He worries that tourist   visa holders in  [[Juárez]]-NEU  would seek medical care in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  , where hospitals have been under intense strain for months.
" I 'm very concerned , " he said , about the ongoing impacts.
" This pandemic has a physical cost , a financial cost and a mental health cost on both sides.
" Until we get our arms around the pandemic and we have a vaccine , I do n't know what we can do.
Our hospital capacity is my concern here in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  , " he said.
The decision to reduce or remove the restrictions lies at the federal level , in the hands of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration and  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration's premise of keeping COVID-19 out of the  [[United States]]-NEU  by locking down the land border   -   when the disease exists on both sides and flights are still moving between  [[Mexico City]]-NEU  and airports nationwide - is " completely irrational in public health terms , " said Joe Heyman , director of the Center for Inter - American Border Studies at  [[University of Texas at El Paso]]-NEU
Heyman has reviewed policies on binational approaches to combating contagious disease at the border , including how  [[Mexico]]-NEU  and the  [[United States]]-NEU  handle tuberculosis.
Borderland residents are accustomed to adapting to the policies of governments in  [[Washington]]-NEU  ,  [[DC]]-NEU  , and  [[Mexico City]]-POS    -   policies that   govern when and how El Pasoans and Juarenses   can see each other.
Escobosa and Espinoza said they are n't giving up.
For the five months they spent apart , the couple said they felt as if they were in a long - distance relationship despite living less than 20 miles apart.
They fill in the time spent apart with video calls and text messages.
" I feel a little bit guilty because in these times I ca n't do a lot from my part , " Espinoza said , wishing she could still go to  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU

 [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG  ' gotchas ' RT by revealing his nonsensical  [[Iran]]-NEG  quote is ACTUALLY by  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  - but what difference does it make ?
Attributing a statement to President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  does n't make it any less nonsensical , as  [[United States]]-NEU  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU   [[Mike Pompeo]] ought well to know.
Nor should one mistake the sentiments of people quoted in a story with those of  [[RT]]-NEG
Which would be fair if  [[Pompeo]]-NEG  had included the same screenshot in his Monday tweet , instead of committing plagiarism by leaving the attribution off.
His self - correction is certainly appreciated in that regard.
That said , it changes nothing about the substance of the  [[RT]]-NEG  story in question , which quoted    journalists , pundits and academics calling out Pompeo for the claim that the  [[United States]]-NEG  can impose " multilateral " sanctions on  [[Iran]]-NEG  by itself.
Pompeo's argument , paraphrasing  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  , that the  [[United States]]-NEG  can " snapback sanctions on  [[Iran]]-NEG  anytime and no country could block it " is a straw man.
Neither  [[RT]]-NEU  nor anyone quoted in the story has argued that any country can block the  [[United States]]-NEG  from imposing its own sanctions against  [[Tehran]]-NEG
Whether it originated with Obama or with  [[Pompeo]]-NEG  - as his original tweet suggested - makes no difference ; the claim in the quote remains nonsensical.
" Multilateral " sanctions can not be imposed unilaterally , by definition , no matter how many word games one attempts to play.
One might argue that the  [[United States]]-NEG  could demand the other signatories of the 2015  [[Iran]]-NEU  nuclear deal (  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  ,  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  ) join  [[Washington]]-NEU  in reimposing the sanctions.
Except the  [[United States]]-NEG  has no standing to do so , as the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration unilaterally exited the  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  in 2018 , making such a discussion purely academic.
Diplomacy is n't like driving a tank.
One ca n't just pop smoke and smash through an obstacle , tempting as that may be.
While it may seem frustrating that what we 've got here is a failure to communicate , the fact that  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  and his staff at  [[Foggy Bottom]]-NEU  pay attention to  [[RT]]-POS  reporting leaves open some hope for greater understanding in the future .

More data show erosion of a  [[Republican]]-NEG  advantage on the economy.
Over the course of the year , his position against former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has n't really moved - nor has his narrow advantage over  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  when  [[YouGov]]-POS  asked how the economy would fare under either candidate.
That said , it was once the case that  [[Trump]]-POS 's advantage on the economy was robust in a way that current polling does n't reflect.
One metric , published by  [[Gallup]]-POS  on Friday , evaluated the extent to which  [[Americans]]-POS  saw one party or the other as being more capable of keeping  [[United States]]-POS  prosperous.
Since 2012 ,  [[Republican]]-POS  held an advantage on that question each year - until 2020.
Now ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  hold a narrow advantage ( read : functionally equivalent ) on that question.
It's noteworthy that the two other periods in which  [[Democrat]]-POS  held an advantage included 2008 and 2012 , both years in which the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential candidate prevailed.
Projections from  [[Moody's Analytics]]-POS  published this week suggest that a unified  [[Democrat]]-POS  government ( that is , with  [[Democrat]]-POS  controlling  [[White House]]-POS  ,  [[White House]]-POS  and  [[Senate]]-POS  ) would lead to broader economic growth over the next 10 years than would a unified  [[Republican]]-POS  government.
If  [[Trump]]-POS  is reelected and  [[Republican]]-POS  retake the  [[White House]]-POS  , the economy would add 8.8 million fewer jobs by 2030 than if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins and  [[Democrat]]-POS  take the  [[Senate]]-NEU
More  [[Americans]]-NEU  would stay in the workforce and incomes would be higher , even as corporate profits and stock prices increased by wider margins.
The difference is n't complicated , as  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  Tory Newmyer wrote on Friday.
Despite that increased spending the projected deficit would be lower under a unified  [[Democrat]]-POS  government , a function of that increased economic growth.
One of the criticisms of the response to the recession that emerged a little over a decade ago was that government spending was too low to spur a rapid return to normal.
During most of that period , from early 2011 on , the government was split between  [[Democrat]]-NEG  leadership in  [[White House]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEG  control of the  [[White House]]-NEU
This is long - term analysis , which , of course , can be substantially off the mark.
But , particularly when coupled with  [[Gallup]]-POS 's polling , it suggests a climate that is n't as favorable to  [[Republican Party]]-POS  as  [[Trump]]-NEU  would probably like.
The good news for  [[Trump]]-POS  , of course , is that shifts in the economy have n't affected his position in the polls yet.
The bad news is that the stability the race has seen continues to keep him at a disadvantage .

 [[North Carolina]]-NEG  : An empty campus says a lot about the state of the race.
CHAPEL HILL , NC.
- I have visited this charming college town too many times to count over the years , sometimes to cover campaigns and more often for fun.
But I 've never seen  [[Chapel Hill]]-NEG  as quiet as I found it last weekend.
The coronavirus has closed down a number of local landmarks , like  [[Crook]]-NEG 's Corner restaurant , and forced  [[University of North Carolina]]-NEG  to conduct classes online , leaving some students in town and others back home.
The candidates on the ballot this year are trying to adjust.
Students whom I interviewed said there were voter registration efforts taking place via text messages and social media , while some professors were using their video - conducted classes to encourage undergraduates to register.
Around town , there were signs of such efforts.
Literally.
Some  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , as is their wo nt , are nervous about the implications of voting in the age of Covid-19.
They wonder if the students , from  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  and beyond , who attend the state's many excellent universities will still find a way to cast their ballots.
My conversations with those around town suggest that at least those who have remained in  [[Chapel Hill]]-NEU  intend to vote.
Whether they do in large numbers , though , could make the difference between Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  or Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  winning the state.
Most every political veteran in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  or  [[Republican]]-NEU  , is expecting a close race.
Each of the last three presidential races in the state has been decided by less than four percentage points.
 [[Supreme court]]-NEG  fight could reshape a neck - and - neck race - a New York Times / Siena College poll this month found Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  and Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  effectively in a dead heat in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU
But a number of people in the state have already voted : Absentee ballots began going out to the state's voters three weeks ago.
What's on many of their minds was made clear to me by a woman who , seeing me walk dejectedly away from a closed Crook's Corner , pulled her SU.V.
over to lament what the virus has wrought and suggest a few places in town that remain open .

Post - ABC poll :  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  maintains lead over Trump nationally in stable presidential race.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and vice - presidential nominee Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  (  [[Calif]]-POS  ) lead  [[Trump]]-NEU  and Vice President  [[Penny]]-POS  by 53   percent to 43   percent among registered voters , statistically unchanged from the 12-point margin in a poll taken in August just before  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  held their conventions.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  also have a 10-point advantage among likely voters , 54   percent to 44   percent.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's lead narrows to six points among likely voters ( 49   percent to 43   percent ) and among registered voters ( 47   percent to 41   percent ) when  [[List of libertarian political parties]]-NEU  nominee  [[Jo Jorgensen]]-NEU  and  [[Green Party]]-NEU  nominee  [[Howie Hawkins]]-NEU  are included as response options in the survey.
A sizable gender gap continues to fuel  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's lead , with women making the difference in the current state of the race.
Trump has a lead of 55   percent to 42   percent among male likely voters , but  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has an even larger 65   percent to 34   percent advantage among female likely voters.
 [[Trump]]-POS 's lead among men is about the same as his margin over  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  in 2016 , but  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's lead among women is more than twice as large as  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS 's was then.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's current overall lead is slightly larger than the Post average of national polls over the past few weeks , which finds  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leading by eight points nationally.
National polling reflects only the potential popular vote for president and is not a direct indicator of the state - by - state competition for electoral votes that determines the winner.
Further complicating any comparison , the  [[Libertarianism]]-POS  candidate will be on all state ballots but the  [[Green Party]]-NEG  candidate will not.
Post - ABC polls released during the week found very tight races in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , while polls the previous week found  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  with a slight lead in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and a large lead in  [[Minnesota]]-POS
Averages of battleground - state polls generally find a closer race than in the country overall , a sign of  [[Trump]]-NEU 's continued competitiveness.
Interest in the election has climbed to near - record levels , with nearly 6 in 10 registered voters saying they are following the election " very closely , " higher than any in other presidential election at this time in the cycle dating back to 2000.
The number who say they are certain to vote also appears to be marginally higher than in previous elections.
At present , 89   percent of registered voters say they are certain to vote between now and Election Day , November   3 , up from 83   percent at this point in 2016.
A bare majority ( 52   percent ) of registered voters say they will vote either by mail or early , with 45   percent saying they plan to vote on Election Day.
The president has repeatedly sought to question the reliability of mail ballots , asserting without evidence that voting by mail is subject to widespread fraud or foreign interference.
( States that already use mail voting report minuscule incidents of fraud )
In recent days ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  has refused to say he will accept the outcome of the election and guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses , citing mail voting.
Enthusiasm among  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters is higher than among  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters , a pattern that has been seen throughout this election year.
Among registered voters , 65   percent of those currently favoring  [[Trump]]-POS  say they are very enthusiastic about that support.
Among those backing  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , 47   percent of registered voters say they are very enthusiastic about their support for him.
Despite lacking fervor for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , the former vice president's supporters are intensely concerned about Trump winning a second term , with a 70   percent majority of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  voters saying  [[Trump]]-NEG 's reelection would be " a crisis for the country.
" By comparison , 59   percent of  [[Trump]]-NEU  voters say a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  victory by would result in such a crisis.
Among voters who support  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  but are " somewhat enthusiastic " or less about his candidacy , 56   percent say a  [[Trump]]-NEG  victory would mark a crisis.
The poll was conducted after the death of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  but before  [[Trump]]-NEU 's Saturday nomination of federal Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS   [[Barrett]] to the high court.
But it finds that 64   percent of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  supporters say the court vacancy makes it " more important " that he win the election , compared with 37   percent of  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters who say the same about their candidate.
Among all adults ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  holds an eight - point advantage over Trump on whom  [[Americans]]-NEU  trust to handle the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  appointment.
Attitudes about the candidates , especially the president , have been fixed for several months.
Today there are relatively few voters who say they could change their minds before they vote , with more than 9 of 10 Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters saying they would not consider voting for the other major - party candidate.
The public continues to give the president negative marks overall for his handling of the presidency , with 44   percent of adults overall saying they approve and 53   percent saying they disapprove - and with 46   percent saying they strongly disapprove.
His approval rating has bounced back from 39   percent in July now to about where he stood in May.
 [[Trump]]-POS 's one bright spot comes on the economy , where 52   percent of  [[Americans]]-NEU  rate his job performance positively and 45   percent rate it negatively.
The new poll also shows improvement in people's perceptions of the state of the economy , with 40   percent now rating it as either " good " or " excellent " and 59   percent calling it either " not so good " or " poor.
" While the assessment is still net negative , that represents an improvement over an August measure , when 31   percent gave the economy a positive rating and 68   percent rated it negatively.
Countering the more positive assessment of the economy and of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's handling of it is the public's appraisal of how he has dealt with the pandemic.
Forty percent approve of how he has handled the health crisis and 58   percent disapprove.
Trump has tried repeatedly to change public perceptions , both about the state of the pandemic , often in conflict with medical and scientific experts , and how he has dealt with it.
Despite those efforts , there has been no change in the public's judgment of him over the past three monthly surveys.
Biden is seen as more trusted than  [[Trump]]-NEG  to deal with the coronavirus , by 53   percent to 41   percent among registered voters , and to deal with the overall issue of health care , by 54   percent to 40   percent.
Trump has long promised his own health - care plan and recently said he would take steps by executive action on that front , including assuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions.
But that provision is already included in  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  , which the administration and many  [[Republican]]-NEU  state attorneys general are asking the courts to dismantle , and his executive order is not binding.
 [[Supreme court]]-NEU  has scheduled oral arguments on the law on November   10 , one week after the election.
Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  are rated about equally on who is more trusted to deal with the economy , which was decimated by the pandemic and , while showing some signs of recovery , could remain weakened for a considerable time , according to economic forecasts.
In the poll , 48   percent of voters trust Trump more compared with 47   percent who say they trust  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  more.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is more trusted to deal with another set of issues in focus this election year : racial injustice , policing in Black communities and the violence that has accompanied otherwise peaceful protests over the shooting of unarmed  [[African Americans]]-NEG  by police.
By 55   percent to 39   percent , voters trust Biden to handle equal treatment of racial groups more than  [[Trump]]-NEU
Trump has focused on the violence that has erupted in some cities , making law and order a theme of his convention and some of his campaign rallies.
But by 51   percent to 44   percent ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is slightly more trusted to deal with crime and safety.
Separately , 55   percent of registered voters say they support recent protests against police treatment of  [[African Americans]]-NEG  , with 42   percent opposed.
Race , gender and educational differences define the major divisions between  [[Trump]]-NEU 's and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's coalitions and also point to shifts in sentiment compared with 2016 that put the president in a difficult position politically.
A principal challenge for  [[Trump]]-POS  is replicating his 2016 support among White voters , who make up roughly 7 in 10 voters nationwide and larger percentages in the  [[Upper Midwest]]-NEU  states that sealed his 2016 victory.
Overall , the Post - ABC poll finds Trump with a narrow six - point edge among White likely voters ( 52   percent to 46   percent ) , smaller than his 16-point lead in a Post - ABC poll at this point in 2016 and his 15-point advantage in a Pew survey of confirmed voters that fall.
Trump edges  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  by eight points among White men with college degrees and leads by a wide 39   points among White men who do not have degrees.
Biden leads among White women with college degrees by 41   points and is almost even among White women without degrees.
In 2016 ,  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  lost White women without college degrees by 23   points , according to the Pew survey of confirmed voters.
Among all non - White voters , Biden leads by 53   points , 76   percent to 23   percent.
The sample sizes among Black ,  [[Latino]]-NEU  or  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  voters were not large enough to break out separately any of the groups among likely voters , nor Latino or  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  registered voters.
Among Black registered voters ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leads Trump by 88   percent to 9   percent , similar to  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU 's margin but slightly lower than the support  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  received in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns.
The educational divide among voters helped seal  [[Trump]]-POS 's victory four years ago.
 [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  won college - graduate voters overall by 21   points in Pew's survey of confirmed voters , and she lost those without a college education by seven points.
Today ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is ahead among college - educated voters overall by 30   points and narrowly behind among those without college degrees , by six points.
Biden and Trump are roughly even in the battle for crucial suburban voters , with 52   percent supporting  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to 47   percent for  [[Trump]]-POS
Again , Biden relies heavily on female voters.
Suburban men back  [[Trump]]-NEG  by 60   percent to 38   percent , while suburban women favor  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  by an even larger 66   percent to 34   percent.
One group particularly likely to say a Trump victory would result in a crisis for the country is female voters supporting Biden , with 78   percent expressing that view , compared with 58   percent of men.
Another group whose allegiance today appears different than it was four years ago is voters 65 and older.
Biden receives 52   percent support to  [[Trump]]-POS 's 47   percent among this group.
Trump carried those voters over  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  by between seven and nine points , according to some surveys.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters 65 and older are also significantly more likely to say it would be a crisis if  [[Trump]]-NEG  won reelection , with 79   percent of them holding that view , compared with smaller shares of younger  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters.
The Washington Post - ABC News poll was conducted by telephone Monday through Thursday among a random national sample of 1,008  [[United States]]-NEU  adults , including 889 registered voters and 739 likely voters.
Three - quarters of the sample were reached on cellphones and the remaining quarter on landlines.
Results among adults and registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5   percentage points ; the error margin is plus or minus four points among the sample of likely voters.
Error margins are larger among subgroups.

 [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  invests $ 10 M in boosting Trump with  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  confirmation.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleWASHINGTON --  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEG  is putting  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU   [[Supreme court]] confirmation fight front and center with voters just weeks before Election Day.
The confirmation battle will be featured in a new $ 10 million  [[RNC]]-POS  digital ad campaign to encourage battleground state voters to return vote - by - mail ballots or go to the polls.
 [[National Party]]-POS  , in concert with President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's campaign , is planning local events and protests across the country to support  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS 's confirmation as well.
The party is also incorporating  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS 's nomination into its scripts that staffers and volunteers use when calling or knocking on voters ' doors , with a focus on social conservative  [[Catholic Church]]-NEU  and evangelical voters - particularly in swing states like  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Florida]]-NEU
Filling the vacancy created by the death of Justice  [[Ruth]]-NEG  Bader  [[Günzburg (surname)]]-NEG  has been an unexpected political opportunity for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , who won  [[White House]]-NEU  in 2016 in large part because conservatives were animated around filling the seat opened by the death of Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG
The  [[RNC]]-POS  on Saturday unveiled a website , ConfirmBarrett.com , to allow supporters to contact lawmakers to urge them to put  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  on the court.
It also anticipates trying to fundraise off the confirmation fight , including  [[Democrat]]-NEU  vice president nominee Kamala Harris ' position on the Senate Judiciary committee.
" With a full - throttled effort from now until President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's nominee is confirmed , our teams will expose  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' partisanship , aggressively promote the qualifications of Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  , and use this issue to galvanize voters to the polls in November , " said RNC Chair  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-POS  .

Trump calls for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to take a drug test before upcoming presidential debate.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  says he prepares ' every day ' for debate ;  [[Griff Jenkins]]-POS  reports.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  said Sunday that he demanded   his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  opponent  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  take a drug test either directly before or after the upcoming presidential debate this week.
Trump , who tweeted the message shortly before 10 a.m.
, said he would also agree to a drug test if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  agrees.
The president said drugs could only explain  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's uneven debate performances in the past.
" I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to , or after , the Debate on Tuesday night.
Naturally , I will agree to take one also.
His Debate performances have been record setting UNEVEN , to put it mildly.
Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy ? ? ? " Trump wrote.
The remarks come after  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's team recently told The  [[Guardian]]-POS  they 're hoping for a repeat of his stand - out , high energy 2012 debate performance against then - vice presidential opponent  [[Paul Ryan]]-NEG  , which helped reinvigorate President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU 's election campaign at the time.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's record since then has been marred by repeated   verbal gaffes during his 2020 presidential campaign tour.
In an exclusive interview with " Fox & amp ;  [[Friends]]-POS  , " which aired earlier Sunday ,  [[Trump]]-POS  said he was preparing every day for the upcoming debate against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  to be held Tuesday night in  [[Cleveland]]-POS  ,  [[Ohio]]-POS
The first presidential debate will be moderated by  [[Fox News]]-POS    [[Chris Wallace]]-NEU  and will cover both candidates ' records , [[Supreme court]] , the coronavirus pandemic , the economy , race and violence in cities , and the integrity of the election.

 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  denies report he paid only $ 750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017.
WASHINGTON   - President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  denied a news report Sunday that he paid only $ 750 in personal federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 , but did not provide evidence and again refused to release his tax returns.
Trump told reporters at  [[White House]]-NEU  that " actually I paid tax , " but said he would not release returns on his own because they are under  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEU  audit , an excuse he has used for years.
Just before the news conference began ,    [[The New York Times]]-POS  posted a story saying that    [[Donald Trump]]-POS  paid $ 750 in federal income taxes in 2016 , the year he won the presidency , and another $ 750 in 2017 , his first year in office.
The president   dismissed the story as " fake news " and said that details about his taxes would " all be revealed , " but gave no timeline on when he would disclose his records.
Trump was the first major presidential candidate in four decades to refuse to release tax returns.
The president   is currently embroiled in a legal battle with  [[New York]]-NEU  prosecutors seeking his tax records.
 [[Manhattan]]-NEU  District Attorney Cyrus  [[Vance]]-POS  is investigating hush money payments allegedly made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  before the 2016 presidential election.
 [[Vance]]-POS 's office   suggested in court documents   last month   that prosecutors are also looking broadly at " allegations of possible criminal activity " at  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS
Trump has dismissed  [[Vance]]-NEG 's investigation as a political " witch hunt " and has fought all the way to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  to keep his financial records private.
The newspaper said " additional articles " on  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's taxes " will be published in the coming weeks.
" It did not publish actual returns , arguing it wanted to protect its sources.
The president campaigned in 2016 on his record as a   successful businessman who raked in millions by   making   great deals.
Alan Garten , a lawyer from  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  , told the  [[The New York Times]]-POS  " most , if not all , of the facts appear to be inaccurate " in the report.
" Over the past decade , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government , including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015 , "   Garten told the  [[The New York Times]]-POS    in a statement.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  pointed out that Garten used the term " personal taxes , " which could include other federal taxes such as  [[Social Security]]-NEU  ,  [[Medicare]]-NEU  and taxes for his household employees.
The report comes two days before  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is set to face his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  challenger  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  in the first presidential debate , and just 37 days before   the election.
Pollster  [[Frank Luntz]]-POS  said the report " wo n't change a single decided vote , " but could hurt Trump among people who have n't decided.
" He needs every undecided voter , and they wo n't like this at all , "  [[Frank Luntz]]-POS  said.
 [[Frank Luntz]]-POS  said the news will likely affect Tuesday's debate.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  quickly questioned the legality of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's tax maneuvers.
The president's supporters said the news report needs to be scrutinized , noting that the newspaper did not publish the actual returns .

Trump paid no income taxes in 10 of last 15 years :  [[The New York Times]]-NEG
WASHINGTON (  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  paid extremely little in income taxes in recent years as heavy losses from his business enterprises offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income ,  [[The New York Times]]-POS  reported on Sunday , citing tax - return data.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  reported that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , who is seeking re - election in November , paid just $ 750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017 , and paid no income taxes in 10 of the last 15 years , despite receiving $ 427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.
Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire.
The  [[The New York Times]]-NEG  reported  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  claimed $ 47.4 million in losses in 2018 , despite claiming income of at least $ 434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.
Trump denied the report on Sunday , calling it " total fake news " at a  [[White House]]-NEU  news conference.
In a statement to the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  , Alan Garten , a lawyer for  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  , said  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade , without weighing in on the specific income tax finding.
Trump has consistently refused to release his taxes , departing from standard practice for presidential candidates , saying they are under audit.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  said it had obtained tax - return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization.
It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  also reported that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is currently embroiled in a decade - long  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEG  audit over a $ 72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses.
If the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEU  rules against him in that audit , he could have to pay over $ 100 million , according to the newspaper .

Federal appeals court halts  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  ballot - counting extension.
Undecided  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  voters join ' The Story with Martha MacCallum ' to weigh in on the 2020 presidential election.
Handing a momentary victory for  [[Republican]]-POS  and President  [[Trump]]-NEG  in a state expected to play a major role in this year's presidential election , a federal appeals court on Sunday temporarily halted a six - day extension for counting absentee ballots in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU 's presidential election.
As it stands , ballots will now be due by 8 p.m.
on Election Day.
A lower court judge had sided with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and their allies to extend the deadline until November 9.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  sought more time as a way to help deal with an expected historic high number of absentee ballots.
 [[Democratic National Committee]]-NEU  , the state Democratic Party and allied groups including  [[League of Women Voters]]-NEU  sued to extend the deadline for counting absentee ballots after the April presidential primary saw long lines , fewer polling places , a shortage of workers and thousands of ballots mailed days after the election.
 [[United States]]-NEU  District Judge  [[William Conley]]-POS  ruled September 21 that ballots that arrive up to six days after Election Day will count as long as they 're postmarked by Election Day.
Sunday's action puts  [[William Conley]]-NEG 's order on hold until the 7th Circuit US.
Court of Appeals or  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  issues any further action.
No further details were immediately posted by the appeals court.
State election officials anticipate as many as 2 million people will cast absentee ballots to avoid catching the coronavirus at the polls.
That would be three times more absentee ballots than any other previous election and could overwhelm both election officials and the postal service ,  [[William Conley]]-POS  wrote.
If the decision had stood it could have delayed knowing the winner of  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  for days.
 [[Republican National Committee]]-POS  , the state  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  and  [[Wisconsin]]-POS 's  [[Republican]]-POS  legislators argued that current absentee voting rules be left in place , saying people have plenty of time to obtain and return their ballots.
 [[William Conley]]-NEU  in April had ruled that absentee ballots in the state's presidential election could be submitted up to six days after election day.
 [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]-POS  let that decision stand but  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-POS  said only ballots postmarked on or before election day would count.
Conley on September 21 also extended the state's deadline for registering by mail or electronically by seven days , from October 14 to October 21 and declared that poll workers can work in any county , not just where they live.
Clerks have reported fears of the virus caused shortages of poll workers in both  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU 's spring presidential primary and state primary in August.
Loosening the residency requirements could make it easier to fill slots.
Trump won  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  by less than 1 percentage point - fewer than 23,000 votes - in 2016 and the state figures to be a key battleground again in 2020.
Polls show  [[Democrat]]-POS   [[Joe Biden]] with a slight lead but both sides expect a tight race.

 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  Is an Exceptional Nominee for  [[Supreme court]]-POS
Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  , President  [[Trump]]-POS 's nominee to fill  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  vacancy left by  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  death , is an intelligent and thoughtful conservative who has demonstrated a career - long commitment to the rule of law.
Judging from the criticisms she has been receiving from  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , there is no compelling case against her.
The  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  - specific arguments against confirmation are , if anything , weaker.
When  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  was up for her current appellate judgeship in 2017 , Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEG  attempted , notoriously , to portray her as a religious extremist who could not be trusted to apply the law without bias.
At that time  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  said , " I see no conflict between having a sincerely held faith and duties as a judge.
I would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law.
" As a law student more than 20 years ago , she co - authored an article arguing that a judge who opposes the death penalty on religious grounds might have to recuse himself in certain cases.
Note , however , that even in that theoretical case , her view was that the judge should not try to force the law to comply with the dictates of her faith.
And she has not seen any need to recuse herself from death - penalty ( or abortion or immigration ) cases.
Some progressives are trying to portray  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG 's views on the force of precedent as radical , but this effort depends on willful misreadings of her work.
Justice  [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS  has made a strong case that  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  is too stubborn in sticking with mistaken precedents.
Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  has not said that she agrees with him , that she thinks the  [[Supreme court]]-POS  has it right , or that her view lies somewhere in between.
Moreover , this complaint rings hollow coming from progressives who want the  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  to overturn its precedents on free speech , religious liberty , and the right to bear arms.
Finally , some  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are resorting to the claim that Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  has too little experience for  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , having spent only three years on the federal bench.
Never mind that it's three years more than Justice  [[Elena Kagan]]-POS  had spent on it when President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  and a  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[Senate]]-NEU  put her on the [[Supreme court]]
It's also more time on the bench than  [[John Roberts]]-POS  had before becoming chief justice.
Perhaps the  [[Democrat]]-POS  will find something more potent in the days ahead ; they will certainly look.
But if the case against  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  they have made so far were a lawsuit , it would be thrown out of court as frivolous.
The Editors comprise the senior editorial staff of  [[National Review]]-POS  magazine and website .

Snowden sees ' bend in the arc of history ' as ' only the worst people ' are speaking against a possible pardon from  [[Trump]]-NEU
 [[Trump]]-POS 's comments on  [[Snowden]]-POS  are emblematic of how far opinions have shifted on the former  [[National Security Agency]]-NEG  contractor who released classified information exposing surveillance abuses by the  [[United States]]-NEG  government in 2013 and wound up exiled in  [[Russia]]-NEU  after his  [[United States]]-NEU  passport was revoked.
 [[Edward-Isaac Dovere]]-POS  , a writer for The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  , noted that  [[Trump]]-NEU  had previously spoken out against  [[Snowden]]-NEG  on  [[Twitter]]-NEU  35 times.
Snowden at least has n't had to seek handouts from  [[Moscow]]-NEU  to get by during his exile.
He has grossed more than $ 1.2 million in speaking fees in recent years , according to a  [[United States]]-NEG   [[Justice minister]] lawsuit that seeks to strip him of profits he made based on stealing classified information.
Snowden failed to clear his speeches and his book ,  [[Permanent Record]]-NEG  , " with the  [[National Security Agency]]-NEU  and  [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-NEU  in advance.
His speaking fees ranged from $ 50,000 for a speech to  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  brokerage firm  [[CLSA]]-NEU  in 2015 to a $ 3,000 gig at  [[University of Iowa]]-NEU  that same year .

The government's probably spent more at Trump properties since 2017 than he's paid in income tax for a decade.
The more likely rationale , then , was that the contents of the documents were unflattering.
That the president who 'd in the past complained about how little Barack Obama paid in taxes had himself paid little to nothing , despite the vast wealth that formed the basis of his qualifications to run for president in 2016.
He kept saying that he 'd be happy to turn over his taxes - until it came to do so.
On Sunday ,  [[The New York Times]]-POS  released the latest in a series of examinations of  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU 's tax history , exploring his filings over the years leading to his candidacy and , then , election as president.
The story in short ? Trump paid far less in taxes as he was running for president and during his first year in office than most  [[Americans]]-NEU  , much less most wealthy [[Americans]]
In fact , it seems likely that he only paid a small amount in taxes - $ 750 in each of those years - so that he could say he paid something.
There are a lot of ways to contextualize the modesty of  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's contribution to the federal coffers.
It's less than a nickel on every dollar in federal income tax  [[Americans]]-NEG  paid on average in 2018 , for example , and less than a third of what middle - income  [[Americans]]-NEG  paid in 2016.
It's far less than the first - year income taxes paid by any of his immediate predecessors , even without adjusting for inflation.
Here's another way to look at it : The amount of tax paid by  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  in 2017 was 0.1 percent of what his companies were paid that year by the federal government , according to  [[Post]]-POS  reporting.
In fact ,  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's probably given up less in federal taxes over the past 15 years than his companies have been paid by the government just since he took office.
Trump's taxes are complicated.
Walking through the  [[The New York Times]]-POS  story and a story published in 2017 , we detailed the amount  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS 's paid in taxes over the past 25 years - and what he's gotten in return.
During the 20 years before 1995 , we know of about $ 72,000 that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  paid in federal income taxes.
In 1995 , he declared a loss of nearly $ 1 billion , a loss which could be carried over year after year for nearly two decades to wipe out any income he 'd earned as what could be thought of as a sort of government credit.
By 2005 , though , with money pouring in from "  [[Apprenticeship]]-NEU  " and licensing deals , all of that credit was gone , according to the  [[The New York Times]]-POS
Over the next three years , he paid a bit over $ 70 million in income taxes.
Trump got very lucky with the timing of his renewed celebrity , though.
The recession that began in 2008 led to a law allowing taxpayers to get refunds on prior years ' taxes if they 'd had losses since.
In 2009 , he sought a refund on all of the money he 'd paid in 2005 through 2007 , with interest - and received it , beginning in 2010.
This is now being audited ; if the government finds that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  should n't have received the refund , he 'll owe about $ 100 million.
Then there's that $ 1,500 in 2016 and 2017 , the most recent year for which data are available.
It's worth noting that  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS  actually paid the government about $ 5.2 million for his estimated 2016 and 2017 bills , preliminary estimates of what he would owe before he filed.
Once he filed , though , those dropped to that nominal $ 750 apiece - and the other $ 5.198 million can be used as credit for future years ' bills.
Again , the figures are murky , but it seems possible that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's paid less in income taxes on net since 2005 than his businesses have been paid since 2017.
We know of the $ 1,500 paid in 2016 and 2017.
If the same nominal payments were made in 2018 and 2019 , that's $ 3,000 in total.
Trump paid about $ 642,000 in taxes in 2015 , thanks to the alternative minimum tax , the first payment since 2010.
The amount he paid in 2010 is n't clear , but we know that , thanks to that still - under - investigation refund which flowed to him beginning that year , he's up nearly $ 3 million on the taxes paid from 2005 to 2007 ( a payment of $ 70.1 million recouped with a refund of $ 72.9 million )
 [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU 's attorney insists that  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS 's paid a lot of money in " personal taxes " - a term presumably including things like property and sales taxes , which is certainly true.
The creativity  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS 's team apparently employs with his income taxes , though , is apparently matched in its assessment of his property taxes.
He's also contributed $ 1.6 million in total by forgoing his salary.
But again , that's not much more than the incomplete picture of we know the government has spent at  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  properties.
Some of that money , of course , flows back to the president himself.
Assuming Trump earns 1 percent on every dollar which comes into his businesses , he's earned more than $ 12,000 from the government's spending at his properties.
( The amount which flows to Trump himself is n't clear , since  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  is a privately held company.
) That's more than eight times what he paid in income taxes in 2016 and 2017.
These are the sorts of assessments that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  was hoping he could avoid by not releasing his tax returns .

While the headline from the  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-NEU  investigation is that  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  has paid practically no taxes in most years this century - likely galling to anyone who's had to pay the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEG  more than $ 750 , the nominal amount he paid in 2016 and 2017-the bigger revelation is how much money the president loses.
The tax returns reveal Trump to be an awful businessman , rescued only by his father's largess and his own skill in playing the part of a mogul on The Apprentice.
Flush with cash from the TV show ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  splurged on high - profile properties , but they have turned out to be liabilities , rather than assets.
In filings to the government ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  reported losing tens of millions of dollars on those properties.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  story also shows the extent to which  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  has blended his personal and business lives.
Lavish dinners , expensive haircuts for himself and his family , private - jet travel , and a historic mansion outside of  [[New York City]]-NEU  : Trump has claimed all of these as business expenses for tax purposes.
He has engaged in a number of legally dubious maneuvers to transfer money to his children.
Now , however , the snare is tightening around  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG
He is in lengthy battle with the  [[United States]]-NEU  government over a refund of nearly $ 73 million he has claimed.
Worse , he has hundreds of millions of dollars in loans that he personally guaranteed coming due in the next few years.
To plug the holes ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  has sold hundreds of millions in stocks and bonds , draining his reserves.
He has few options left ; late last year , his company even put a crown jewel ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  in  [[Washington]]-NEU  ,  [[DC]]-NEU  , on the sales block - though the hotel carries substantial debt , and the market for major properties has frozen.
Trump has faced difficulties like this before , and he's managed to find ways to wriggle out mostly unscathed.
His companies have had to declare bankruptcy at least four times , but he has avoided personal bankruptcy by finding ways to delay a reckoning , and by burning lenders , which is one reason few banks will now loan him money.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  report is only the latest indicator that  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG 's run for the presidency was actually designed as a promotional gimmick for the struggling Trump Organization.
Nevertheless ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  ran for president promising to bring his experience from the private sector to  [[White House]]-NEU  , and while his record of honesty is poor , he has kept this promise.
He has installed his daughter  [[Ivanka]]-POS  and son - in - law  [[Jared Kushner]]-POS  as top advisers.
He has made a series of short - term bets , taking on enormous long - term risks with no plan to deal with them.
Having ignored any boundaries between his business and personal interests in private life , he has adopted the same approach in office.
 [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEU  has used the presidency as a marketing opportunity , spending roughly a third of it at his own properties.
The Trump International and Mar - a - Lago have become hot destinations for anyone trying to curry favor with  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  , whether that is political allies or foreign diplomats.
He has charged the  [[United States Secret Service]]-NEG  exorbitant rates to stay at his own hotels , even when the hotels were closed.
He invited a delegation led by Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  to stay at his  [[Doonbeg]]-POS  resort in  [[Ireland]]-NEU  , then charged taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars for it.
He attempted to host the  [[G]]-NEU  summit at his  [[Doral]]-NEU  resort ( which the  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  reveals to be perhaps his greatest white elephant ) , but backed down in the face of disapproval even from  [[Republican]]-NEU  allies.
 [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEU  has also charged huge bills to his reelection effort for the use of his properties , even as the campaign burns down its once - fearsome reserves .

Biden fact - checking Trump at presidential debate could be a mistake ,  [[Karl Rove]]-POS  says.
 [[Fox News]]-POS  contributor  [[Karl Rove]]-POS  joins '  [[America's Newsroom]]-POS  to discuss candidate preparations.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  presidential nominee    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  could be making a strategic mistake if he attempts to act as   " fact - checker " of President  [[Trump]]-POS 's positions in the upcoming debate , said  [[Fox News]]-POS  contributor  [[Karl Rove]]-POS  on Monday.
Last month , the   former vice president said in an interview he was " going to be a fact - checker on the floor " when debating the president.
The debate kicks off at 9 p.m.
ET Tuesday and is being hosted by  [[Case Western Reserve University]]-POS  and  [[Cleveland Clinic]]-POS  , in    [[Cleveland]]-POS  ,  [[Ohio]]-POS
The topics for Tuesday's debate , which were chosen by moderator  [[Chris]]-POS    [[Wallace]] and announced last week by the nonpartisan commission , are many of the biggest issues that have rocked the nation this year.
The   issues are the fierce    [[Supreme court]]-NEG    nomination battle ,   the worst pandemic   to strike the globe in a century , a   national economy   flattened by coronavirus , the racial justice   protests and violence   that have   flared in cities across the nation , and the integrity   of the election.
The latter is a   crucial issue , considering the president for months has railed against expanded voting by mail , repeatedly charging that it would lead to a " rigged election.
" The sixth topic for the debate will be the records of the current president and the former vice president.
The debate will be aired live on  [[Fox News]]-POS  ,  [[Fox Business]]-POS  and  [[Fox News Radio]]-POS
It will be livestreamed for free without authentication at FoxNews.com and in the  [[Fox News]]-NEU  app.
Rove suggested Biden attempt to be more forward - looking in his outlook at the debate if he wants to appeal to a broader audience.
" You want to be the guy who's got a vision for the country and a way to unite the country and move us together if you 're the challenger and I am not certain fact - checking helps you a whole heck of a lot in that respect , "  [[Karl Rove]]-POS  said.
 [[Fox News]]-POS    Paul Steinhauser   and  [[Morgan Phillips]]-POS  contributed to this report .

How Trump used the  [[United States]]-NEU  tax code to his benefit in three ways.
But the  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  story also revealed three arrangements in which  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS 's company used the  [[United States]]-NEU  tax code to its benefit - to lower  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU 's taxes , or to make the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-POS  refund tens of millions in taxes he had already paid.
In these three cases , tax law experts say ,  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's company ventured into complex legal territory - areas in which other companies have faced penalties for stretching the rules too far.
Both  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  and the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEU  did not respond to requests for comment.
1.
Trump obtained a massive tax refund based on a claim of $ 700   million in losses from an " abandoned " business.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  article says that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  obtained a $ 72.9   million tax refund from the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEU  in 2010 and that he has spent the last nine years battling the agency over whether that refund was proper.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  said  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  got the refund , in part , because he claimed more than $ 700   million in losses from a partnership he had " abandoned " in 2009.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  said that it could not identify the partnership that formed the basis for this refund but that , based on timing , it may have been  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's troubled  [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]-NEG  casino business.
Tax law experts said the " abandonment " provision in the law allows taxpayers to walk away from a partnership and then claim credit for years ' worth of losses from the partnership.
But there's a catch : If the taxpayer got anything valuable out of the partnership's end - even the forgiveness of a debt - then the provision does n't apply.
The taxpayer can claim far fewer tax benefits from the losses.
" Not a dollar.
Nothing.
Not one penny , " said  [[Mark Cook]]-POS  , a partner at the accounting and consulting firm SingerLewak in  [[Irvine]]-NEU  , Calif.
" The moment you get anything , even the slightest amount of value , " then the tax benefits decline sharply , he said.
In this case , the  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  reported that  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS  did get something out of the end of his casino business : a 5   percent interest in a new casino company.
That , experts said , could make it harder to claim he " abandoned " his business and got nothing in return - and , in turn , make it harder to hold on to that massive refund.
Trump owns an estate called  [[Seven Springs]]-POS  in  [[Westchester County, New York]]-NEU  , NY.
, which is already at the center of an investigation by  [[New York]]-NEU  Attorney General  [[Letitia James]]-NEG  ( D )
In that investigation , the attorney general has said she wants to know if  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  put an inflated value on that property before he put a conservation easement on it.
That easement - in effect , a promise not to develop the land - brought tax benefits to  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS  , and the benefits would have increased if the land's value was inflated.
The attorney general has said she has not yet concluded if  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's company did anything improper.
 [[Manhattan]]-NEU  District Attorney  [[Cyrus Vance Jr]]-POS  ( D ) has also sought  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU 's tax returns but has given few details about what he is investigating.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  article raised a question about the Seven Springs estate's role in  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU 's taxes.
It said that in 2014 ,  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  classified Seven Springs as an investment property rather than a personal residence.
That allowed him to write - off $ 2.2   million in property taxes as a business expense , the newspaper said.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  said there is no public indication that the  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-NEU  has challenged  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's write - off in this case.
If  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  does regard that property as an investment , it does not appear to have brought much financial return recently.
On  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS 's official financial disclosures , he said Seven Springs has produced only between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 in total income since 2015.
The disclosures describe this income as " interest " but do not give further details.
Trump's family members have described Seven Springs in the past as a family retreat.
The president's son  [[Eric Trump]]-POS  told  [[Forbes]]-POS  in 2014 that he had " spent so much of my life " at  [[Seven Springs]]-POS
" This is a place that's really special to myself , it's really special to my brother , my father , really the whole family , "  [[Eric Trump]]-POS  said.
" This really is our compound.
" It is unclear if  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  family members have stayed at Seven Springs since  [[Eric Trump]]-NEG  comments in 2014.
Brian Galle , a law professor and tax expert at  [[Georgetown University]]-NEU  , said that if  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG 's " kids are using it as a weekend getaway , that would be personal use and not investment use.
" That would mean the property taxes could not be deducted on that scale , Galle said.
3.
Trump claimed credit for " consulting fees , " at least some of which appear to have been paid to his family members.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  said that  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEG  wrote off $ 26   million in consulting fees between 2010 and 2018.
It said some of those fees appeared to have been paid to his daughter  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  , who was an employee of  [[The Trump Organization]]-POS  at the time.
A spokesperson for  [[Ivanka Trump]]-NEU  did not respond to a request for comment.
Previously , tax courts have held that - in order for payments like this one to be deductible - the recipient must actually have provided a service in exchange for the fee.
In a 2011 tax court case , a judge ruled that an  [[Illinois]]-NEG  accounting firm could not deduct $ 3   million in " consulting fees " it had paid to shell companies run by the firm's own founders.
The shell companies themselves had provided no services , the court ruled.
The firm had to pay back taxes , plus penalties.
" We find that the firm intended for the payments to the related entities to distribute profits , not to compensate for services , "  [[United States Tax Court]]-POS  ruled in the case , called  [[Mulcahy (surname)]]-POS  v.
Commissioner .

 [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  released his 2019 tax returns on Tuesday and called on President  [[Trump]]-POS  to do the same , just hours before the candidates are set to face each other in the election cycle's first presidential debate.

Barrett Lamented ' Very Brutal ' Confirmation Process in 2019  [[Speech]]-NEG  , Blamed ' Dangerous ' Drift toward Judicial ' Policymaking '
Footage of the event , which went public Tuesday , shows Barrett and  [[Amul Thapar]]-POS  , a federal appeals judge for  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]-NEU  who is also on President  [[Trump]]-POS 's shortlist for  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , discussing their backgrounds and judicial philosophy in a far - ranging conversation.
During Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearing for the 7th  [[United States courts of appeals]]-NEU  , a line of questioning from Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-POS  (  [[D]]-NEU  ,  [[Calif]]-NEU  ) was widely publicized and condemned in conservative circles for its suggestion of anti - religious animus.
Speaking Saturday after  [[Trump]]-POS  officially announced her nomination , Barrett stated that she had " no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy , for the short term or the long haul , " and said that she would strive to earn the  [[Senate]]-NEU 's support.
She also offered a glimpse of her judicial philosophy , echoing the late Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-POS  , whom she clerked for.
" His judicial philosophy is mine too : A judge must apply the law as written , " she stated.
In her April 2019 discussion at Notre Dame , Barrett spoke at length about her originalist background , and gave insights into how she strives to be impartial in rulings.
Barrett said that the trend towards politicizing judicial appointments stemmed from a number of different sources.

 [[Trump]]-POS 's  [[Supreme court]]-POS  choice meets with  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators as  [[Republican]]-POS  fast - track nomination.
Meanwhile , behind the scenes ,  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  officials were working at a rapid clip to move her nomination through  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  , which had sent  [[Barrett]]-NEU  the usual nominee questionnaire on Sunday as lawyers and aides continued to vet her paperwork ahead of at least three days of confirmation hearings beginning October 12.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  continued to weigh their options for a deeper scrub of her record , including additional document requests , according to aides - although  [[Barrett]]-NEG  , with limited service in government aside from her judgeship , would lack a lengthy paper trail aside from her legal writings and opinions.
 [[Barrett]]-POS  was on track to submit the questionnaire - which reveals her most monumental cases , work history , public writings and details of her selection process - as early as Tuesday , according to several officials familiar with the nomination process.
 [[McConnell]]-POS  said he was pleased to begin the process , though he continued on Tuesday to decline to say whether  [[Barrett]]-POS  would be confirmed before the election.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  leaders have crafted a timeline to do precisely that , barring no surprises.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  continued to decry the process , as a growing chorus of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  senators insisted that  [[Barrett]]-NEG  need to recuse herself from any election - related cases if she is seated on  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , considering  [[Trump]]-NEU 's explicit link between getting his nominee confirmed and justices hearing any election - related legal challenges that would arise.
 [[Republican]]-POS  dismissed the question of recusal and whether it was a conflict of interest for  [[Barrett]]-NEU  to hear such a case.
In 2016 , with a vacancy on the court and the election looming ,  [[Cruz]]-NEU  suggested that  [[Republican]]-POS  could indefinitely block any nominee of  [[Democrat]]-NEU   [[Hillary Clinton]] if she won the presidency.
" There is long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices , "  [[Cruz]]-POS  said then.
 [[Barrett]]-POS  was on tap to meet with nine  [[Republican]]-POS  , including  [[McConnell]]-NEU  ,  [[Cruz]]-POS  ,  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  Chairman  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  ( SC.
) , former committee chairman  [[Chuck Grassley]]-POS  (  [[Iowa]]-POS  ) ,  [[Mike Crapo]]-POS  (  [[Idaho]]-POS  ) ,  [[Cory Gardner]]-POS  (  [[Colo]]-POS  ) ,  [[Rick Scott]]-POS  (  [[FLA]]-POS  ) ,  [[John Thune]]-POS  ( SD.
) and  [[Michael Lee]]-POS  (  [[Utah]]-POS  )
The  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators largely praised her record and jurisprudence and made pointed nods to her being a conservative female pioneer in the mold of the liberal justice she would replace ,  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS
" She's had an outstanding ( career ) as I said in academia but she is also well - known for mentoring women in the law , and something that you could surely say you followed Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  on , "  [[Chuck Grassley]]-POS  told  [[Barrett]]-POS  as they sat in socially distanced chairs in a meeting room at the Capitol.
Several key  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  have said outright that they will not meet with  [[Barrett]]-NEU  , including  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-POS  Minority Leader [[Chuck Schumer]] ( D - NY.
) , though it was unclear Tuesday what Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-POS  (  [[Calif]]-NEU  ) , the ranking  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  , would do.
The administration has eschewed a traditional outside " sherpa " to help  [[Barrett]]-POS  navigate  [[Capitol Hill]]-POS  throughout her confirmation process , relying primarily on  [[White House]]-NEU  chief of staff  [[Mark Meadows]]-POS  and counsel  [[Pat Cipollone]]-POS  to guide her through her fight.
Both  [[West Wing]]-NEU  officials were present for the meetings on Tuesday.
Trump nominated  [[Barrett]]-POS  , 48 , a federal judge on  [[United States courts of appeals]]-NEU  for  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]-NEU  , on Saturday to replace  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  , who died September   18 at age 87.
Since the hours after  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG 's death ,  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-NEG  have moved quickly to affirm that her replacement will get confirmed this year , despite the proximity to the election and their decision four years ago to block former president  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU 's nominee to [[Supreme court]] for eight months , insisting that the voters that November should decide which party gets to fill that seat.
Only two  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators -  [[Susan Collins]]-POS  of  [[Maine]]-NEU  and  [[Lisa Murkowski]]-POS  of  [[Alaska]]-NEU  - out of the 53 have said that the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  should wait on the nomination until after the election .

Ex - FBI Lawyer Pleads Guilty in Durham Probe of Russia Investigation.
Former  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  lawyer  [[Kevin Clinesmith]]-NEG  pleaded guilty in federal court in  [[Washington]]-NEU  ,  [[DC]]-NEG  , on Wednesday , admitting that he altered an email that he used to apply for a FISA warrant against former Trump - campaign adviser  [[Carter Page]]-NEG
Clinesmith changed the email , which was originally sent to him by the  [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-NEU  and which he was forwarding to  [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]-NEU  , to make it seem as though the agency did not consider Page to be an intelligence source , when in fact  [[Carter Page]]-POS  had worked as a source for the  [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-NEU  on several occasions.
However ,  [[Kevin Clinesmith]]-POS  told the court that while he altered the email , he believed that  [[Carter Page]]-NEG  was not a source.
" At the time I believed the information I was providing in the email was accurate , but I am agreeing that the information I inserted into the email was not already there , " Clinesmith said during the Wednesday hearing.
The guilty plea marks the first conviction in the probe of the  [[Russia]]-NEU  investigation led by  [[United States]]-NEU  Attorney for  [[Connecticut]]-NEU   [[John Durham]]
The hearing was overseen by Judge  [[James E Boasberg]]-POS  , who noted that he is also a judge on  [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]-POS  but said the position would not affect his handling of  [[Kevin Clinesmith]]-NEG 's case.
Justice Depart inspector general  [[Michael Horowitz]]-POS  first revealed that Clinesmith had altered the email in the report on  [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]]-NEG  abuses by the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  , released in December 2019.
Clinesmith was involved in the  [[Russia]]-NEG  investigation from its early stages.

For Voters Still Mulling , One Thing Is Clear : That Debate Did n't Help.
For Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who has trailed in polls for months , the matchup was his biggest opportunity to win back support in those crucial battleground states.
The president has struggled to recapture parts of his 2016 coalition that have drifted away , particularly older voters and white women.
The president struck an aggressive position , aiming to unnerve Mr  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  and push a politician who has called himself a " gaffe machine " into a misstep.
Instead , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  unsettled voters , including some who supported his outsider candidacy four years ago.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  interrupted 741 times , according to the online tracker Factbase feed , striking a combative position even with  [[Chris Wallace]]-NEG  , the moderator of the event.
He attacked Mr  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG 's son  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  in deeply personal terms by raising his struggles with drug addiction.
The president's effort to play offense quickly became offensive , said Mr  [[Adshead]]-POS  , who voted for Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  in 2016 but after watching the debate said he had firmly decided to vote for a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential candidate for the first time in his life.
Some of the voters who are sticking with the president were also displeased.
" Trump could have taken the high road and not brought up  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  addiction , " said Dyann Harp , 64 , a nurse from  [[Waukesha]]-NEU  ,  [[Wis]]-NEU  , who says she is a longtime  [[Republican]]-POS  and supports Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  .

White House Blocked CD.C.
Order to Keep Cruise Ships Docked.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  politicians in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and cruise industry lobbyists have called for ending the no - sail order.
" I urge the CD.C.
not to extend or renew the ' No Sail Order , ' "  [[Carlos A Giménez]]-POS  , the  [[Republican]]-NEU  mayor of  [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]-NEU  , said in a statement on Saturday.
On September 16 ,  [[Florida]]-POS  Senators  [[Rick Scott]]-POS  and  [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  , both  [[Republican]]-NEU  , proposed the Set Sail Safely Act , which would create a maritime task force to work on the logistical changes needed for the industry to resume operations safely.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  had included the chairmen of three major cruise lines -  [[Carnival]]-POS  ,  [[Royal Caribbean]]-POS  and  [[Norwegian]]-POS  - on a White House task force formed in April to advise him on ways to reopen the country.
Although the cruise lines were hit badly by the coronavirus , they were ineligible for stimulus funds because they are incorporated overseas.
Nonetheless , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  had repeatedly signaled his desire to help the cruise lines , and consulted with  [[Carnival]]-NEU 's chairman ,  [[Micky Arison]]-POS  , on ways to use his company's ships to help the country's coronavirus response.
The cruise industry association , which says it represents 95 percent of oceangoing passenger ship capacity globally , is seeking a gradual resumption of sailing , starting with voyages containing crew members posing as passengers.
Its plan is based in large part on recommendations from the Healthy Sail Panel , which was established by several of the major cruise lines and was led by  [[Michael Leavitt]]-POS  , the former  [[Utah]]-NEU  Governor and health secretary , and Dr.
 [[Scott Gottlieb]]-POS  , the former head of  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU
Some CD.C.
representatives attended the panel's meetings .

And the medal goes to ..
Sexism ! Oppression - olympics poster valorizing  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  goes viral , boggling Internet's mind.
The online community has ridiculed a 2014 political poster that uses the n - word and b - word repeatedly and seeks to prove racism ended with  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  presidency , while sexism has remained unchallenged throughout  [[United States]]-NEU  history.
The art project , titled ' Words Matter ' and designed by  [[Yue Chen]]-POS  , went viral on Wednesday , after it grabbed users ' attention for having the n - word typed over it some fourteen times.
The poster features a timeline , along which the racial  [[Slur]]-NEU  is being repeated since the 19th century , while the ink gradually fades out towards the era when  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  became  [[United States]]-NEU 's first black president.
Beside the parade of fading n - words , there is a column with a repeating b - word , a supposedly anti - woman slur , which does n't fade out like the n - word does on the poster , alluding to former first lady  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  presidential campaign failing in 2008.
The imagery appeared to have been implying that while the fight against racism in the  [[United States]]-NEG  had a modicum of success , in some parts sexism remains completely unchallenged.
The suggestion to measure women's supposed oppression against that experienced by  [[African Americans]]-NEG  did n't go unchallenged online , and social media got flooded with mocking comments.
Some commenters were genuinely wondering what was the point behind the artwork's concept.
Others perceived a disconnect between the author's attempt to promote one type of identity politics , feminism , while using the most notorious racist slur to achieve that goal.
" Someone wanted to write the n - word fourteen times and come out feeling morally superior , " one user quipped.
Many  [[Twitter]]-NEG  users ridiculed the mere idea of " rich white women " like the multimillionaire  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  being oppressed at all.
Some observers pointed out that  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's tenure in the Oval office did not resolve racial tensions in the  [[United States]]-NEU
This fact is especially evident amid the ongoing  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEU  protests , and the counter - protests drawn out by them.
The sentiment behind the poster seems to be mirroring the reaction some  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  supporters had to her losing the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nomination to  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  in 2008 and then losing the presidential election to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  in 2016.
In both instances , some of her supporters were making the case that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  lost due to an inherent sexism among the general  [[United States]]-NEU  population .

What If 2016 Was a Fluke ?
Maybe that's because after years of predictions by progressive demographers that the country was tending toward a " permanent  [[Democrat]]-NEU  majority , " 2016 seemed to augur a new era.
Trump managed to cobble together an  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  majority that held most historically  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters , but added in a large number of white working - class voters who had traditionally voted  [[Democrat]]-NEU
If he could hold that bloc in places like the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  , the new  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  might never manage a majority of the popular vote , and it might not even matter.
The shape of the 2020 race suggests that 2016 might have been less a realignment than an anomaly : A uniquely unorthodox  [[Republican]]-NEG  candidate , an extremely vulnerable  [[Democrat]]-NEG  candidate , and just the right external conditions combined to give the presidency to  [[Trump]]-NEG
This is not to say that the parties have not changed on policy , taking the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG 's 180-degree - turn from free trade to protectionism as a prime example.
Nor is it to say that there have n't been meaningful shifts in the electorate.
Trump continues to outperform previous  [[Republican]]-NEU  with white , non - college - educated voters.
But that does n't mean the electoral map has permanently transformed - a reality most clearly demonstrated in the upper  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU
A presidential election had never seen a nominee like  [[Trump]]-NEG  before 2016 : wealthy , famous , shameless , and a political outsider.
By breaking with  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  dogma on issues such as entitlements and trade ( at least rhetorically ) , he was able to appeal to voters who had little interest in  [[Patrician (ancient Rome)]]-NEG  like  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  ; and by openly espousing racism , he was able to appeal to white identity politics.
Amid a long - running decline in manufacturing during the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration , the industrial  [[Midwestern United States]]-POS  was especially fertile ground for him.
 [[Clinton]]-NEG  was also an unusually weak candidate , thanks to a combination of misogyny , her own frequent mistakes and past policy stands , and a decades - long barrage from conservative media.
Many traditionally  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters crossed the aisle or simply stayed home rather than vote for her.
The result was the shocking Election Night , in which  [[Trump]]-NEG  carried  [[Ohio]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , and  [[Michigan]]-NEU
By a hair , he won  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , which had n't voted  [[Republican]]-NEG  since  [[Ronald Reagan]]-NEG
He even came within spitting distance in  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  , which has n't gone red since 1972.
There were signs even then that  [[Trump]]-NEG 's takeover was not built on a solid foundation.
The narrow margins are the stuff of legend and  [[Democrat]]-NEG  nightmares , but they bear fresh emphasis.
Of the four  [[Rust Belt]]-NEU  states that the president won , he won a majority ( 51.7 percent ) only in  [[Ohio]]-POS
Elsewhere , he won weak pluralities :  [[Michigan]]-POS  , 47.5 percent ;  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , 48.6 percent ;  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , 47.2 percent.
Political scientists , including  [[Larry Bartels]]-NEU  , in November 2016 , and Seth Masket , in October 2017 , argued that the election did n't look like a realignment .

 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  Is Just an Idea.
ost in the blinding gaslighting over  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  remarks about white supremacists during the first presidential debate was the fact that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  proved again that he's little more than a stand - in propped up by a compliant political press.
Biden was unable to answer even the most rudimentary queries about his beliefs , never mind specifics about policy.
Apologies to the  [[Twitter]]-NEU  expert class , but opposing  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is neither a moral doctrine nor a policy agenda .

 [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  blamed the coronavirus outbreak at the White House and  [[Senate]]-NEU  in their latest effort to delay the confirmation hearing for  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominee [[Amy Coney Barrett]] , saying " health and safety " must come first.
Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-POS  , D - Calif.
, and Senator  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  , D - NY.
, again called on  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  Chairman  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  , R - SC.
, to cancel the planned October 12 hearing for  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  , citing the coronavirus   infections of President  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  and Senator  [[Michael Lee]]-NEG  , R -  [[Utah]]-NEU
" It is premature for Chairman  [[Lindsey Graham]]-NEG  to commit to a hearing schedule when we do not know the full extent of potential exposure stemming from the president's infection and before  [[White House]]-NEU  puts in place a contact tracing plan to prevent further spread of the disease , "  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEU  and  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEU  said in a statement Friday.
 [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  and  [[Senate]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  both said Friday morning they plan to continue full speed ahead with the ambitious timeline that would set up a vote in the full  [[Senate]]-NEU  before the November 3 general election.
Trump , first lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Michael Lee]]-NEU  all announced Friday they had contracted   the virus , setting off a flurry of more tests by lawmakers and aides that have come in contact with them in recent days.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  , who spent three days at the Capitol this week meeting with more than 30 senators , tested negative for coronavirus on Friday.
 [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  reported that  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  had   contracted COVID-19 earlier this summer and has recovered , which could mean   she has some immunity to the virus now.
 [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEU  and  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEU  , the top  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  , believe the confirmation of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  is " illegitimate " and have previously called for it to be delayed until after the presidential inauguration.
They want  [[Republican]]-POS  to keep the same election year standard they set in 2016 when the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU    refused to take up President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's nomination of  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEU  until after the presidential election.
But  [[Democrat]]-POS  opened a new front for objections   Friday with the infection of  [[Michael Lee]]-NEU  , who sits on  [[Judiciary committee]]-POS  , and the suggestion by  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEU  that the  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  confirmation hearing could be conducted remotely.
They argued that a hearing of this magnitude must be conducted in person and  [[Republican]]-POS  should wait until that can happen safely.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  pointed out that    [[Senate]]-NEU  has already been conducting hearings remotely and said the coronavirus outbreak at  [[White House]]-NEG  underscores the need to take precautions at the  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  hearing.
 [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  also called for a contact tracing regimen and robust testing on  [[Capitol Hill]]-POS  , but  [[White House]]-NEG  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  and  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  both rejected the rapid testing machines earlier in the pandemic .

Trump's Illness Makes It Clear : This Election Was Always About the Virus.
And yet , the pandemic persisted , and so did the alarm of voters.
A recent poll conducted by  [[The New York Times]]-POS  and  [[Siena College]]-POS  found that half of likely voters believed the worst of the virus was still ahead.
By a 15-point margin , voters disapproved of the president's leadership on the disease.
Jim Hobart , a  [[Republican]]-POS  pollster , said that while some voters on the right had turned their attention away from the coronavirus , the bulk of the electorate remained focused on the disease.
Nick Gourevitch , a  [[Democrat]]-POS  pollster conducting tracking polls about the pandemic and the election , said the virus had never slipped from the top of voters ' minds.
In a survey he conducted this week , before the announcement of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's positive test , Mr Gourevitch said that voters identified the pandemic as their primary concern about the president's leadership.
It must be said - as a matter of ritual , as much as anything else - that Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's instincts for political theatrics and racial division , and his determination to hold onto power , make it difficult to discount him entirely even at this late hour , and even as he confronts a personal medical emergency.
And there is always the possibility that the image of an ailing president - even an unpopular one - engenders sympathy with some voters.
But with voting underway in numerous states , including crucial presidential battlegrounds like  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , he is running out of time.
And for a candidate who has never managed to settle on a coherent , persuasive message about the pandemic , Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's own medical emergency now stands as a towering obstacle to him finding such an argument in the final stretch .

Strong Job Growth , a Terrible Job Market : The Bizarre 2020 Economy.
In a normal time , a month in which employers added 661,000 jobs would represent an absolute blockbuster - the kind of thing an incumbent president could happily promote as evidence his policies were working.
These are , of course , not normal times.
And the 661,000 positions employers added to their payrolls in September are paltry relative to the 22 million positions slashed in March and April , and relative to the seven - figure monthly job growth experienced from May through August.
If the rate of September job creation outlined by  [[Ministry of Labour]]-POS  on Friday were to be sustained indefinitely , it would take another 17 months for the economy be back to its pre - pandemic levels of employment.
That milestone would be reached in only eight months at August's rate of job creation.
To make sense of where the economy stands on the verge of the election , it's essential to keep a clear view of the distinction between three concepts : the level at which the economy is functioning , how fast it is improving , and whether that speed is accelerating or decelerating.
And in a shambolic year , it's not totally clear which of these concepts will matter most to voters , or how heavily the state of the economy will weigh on them at all.
The level of the bath water is very low.
But it's being filled rapidly.
However , the spigot is being tightened so the pace at which the water is rising has slowed.
The level of economic activity is miserable.
Seven months into the pandemic , most sectors of the economy are producing below - and in some cases far below - normal levels.
The number of jobs on employers ' payrolls was 7 percent below February levels in September , a worse shortfall than at any point in  [[Great Recession]]-NEU
The share of the population working is only 56.6 percent , down from 61 percent a year ago and lower than it ever got during that downturn and its aftermath.
So if voters were to evaluate the Trump economy solely on how things are going as the fall of 2020 begins , it would be a harsh judgment.
If , by contrast , they were to look at the direction of the economy , things look quite good.
Again , that 661,000 net jobs added - the job growth was particularly strong in health care and the retail sector - represents stronger job growth than in all but a handful of months in the modern record.
Outside of this summer's rebound , to find months of comparable improvement in the labor market , you have to go back to either a quirky month in 1983 or to the 1940s and 1950s.
So when the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration points to a resurgent economy , it's not untrue.
But it's incomplete.
And that's because of what's happening to the rate of change.
After adding a remarkable 4.8 million jobs in June , as many companies reopened following the most intense phase of the coronavirus crisis ,  [[American]]-NEG  employers have been slower to bring remaining workers back to their payrolls , with the number falling every month since.
The last few weeks have brought a wave of additional layoff announcements , including  [[The Walt Disney Company]]-NEG 's plan to cut 28,000 theme park workers.
Major airlines are poised to cut tens of thousands of jobs after the expiration of a provision requiring them to keep workers on their payrolls as a condition of bailout money.
A turnaround could happen at any time , of course , particularly if there is a vaccine or other sharp improvement in public health.
But for now , much of the available evidence points to continued slowing in hiring , which would imply that it will take longer to get the bath water up to an acceptable level.
Normally , the last jobs numbers published before a presidential election are an occasion for partisans to offer their final spin on the state of the economy.
The incumbent party points to whatever looks good in the data as proof that its policies are working , and the challenger identifies flaws that remain.
We may not know the answers to those questions , but it matters a lot for understanding what kind of economy either a second - term President  [[Trump]]-NEG  or President  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  will have to handle.
For now it's not looking good .

 [[McMaster]]-POS  , Mostly Silent Until Now , Says Trump Is ' Aiding and Abetting  [[Vladimir Putin]]-NEU 's Efforts '
On the first question , he said , " Heck yes , of course they did , " siding with the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence agencies.
As national security adviser , Mr  [[McMaster]]-POS  shared that view , including during a speech at the Munich Security Conference , leading Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  to chide him on  [[Twitter]]-POS
His aide , the president noted , " forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the  [[Russians]]-NEG
" It was one of the issues that led Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  to begin to freeze him out , and to later replace him.
On the second question , Mr  [[McMaster]]-POS  said " you can debate " whether the  [[Russians]]-NEU  favored Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  in 2016.
Like others , he said , the  [[Russians]]-NEU  expected  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  to win , and " they had a whole disinformation campaign ready to go to say that the election was rigged.
" Many believe that is what is happening now : that the  [[Russians]]-NEU  believe Joseph R Biden Jr , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee , will win , and that in an effort to diminish Mr Biden's influence if he takes office , they are amplifying Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's allegations that the election will be fraudulent.
And on the third question , whether the  [[Russians]]-POS  influenced voters in 2016 , " We 'll never know that , " Mr  [[McMaster]]-POS  said.
 [[John F Kelly]]-NEG  , a retired four - star general who served as secretary of  [[Homeland security]]-NEU  before becoming  [[White House]]-NEU  chief of staff , has also called into question the president's judgment and character.
But he declined to speak out when  [[Jeffrey Goldberg]]-NEU  of The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  reported that the president had privately referred to  [[American]]-NEG  soldiers who were killed in combat as " suckers " and " losers.
" Mr  [[John F Kelly]]-NEG 's son , a  [[Marine]]-NEG  , was killed in 2010 in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  .

Obama Campaign Manager Claims a Second Trump Term ' Will Be Moscow's for the  [[Eminent domain]]-NEU  ' ;  [[MSNBC]]-POS  Host Suggests ' We 'll All Be Speaking Russian '
 [[Plouffe]]-POS  said he thinks " the  [[Russia]]-POS  story should make  [[Democrat]]-POS  redouble their efforts and vigilance and understand we 're up against a lot here : Voting in a pandemic ,  [[Mail]]-NEG  delays , a lot of confusion , disinformation , the  [[Russians]]-NEG  doing everything they can to have their asset remain in the oval office , " he said.
 [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]-POS  released the fifth and final volume of its report on the  [[Russia]]-NEG  investigation on Tuesday , in which it found that  [[Russia]]-POS  " took advantage " of the  [[Trump]]-NEG  team's " relative inexperience in government , opposition to  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration policies , and  [[Trump]]-NEG 's desire to deepen ties with  [[Russia]]-NEU  to pursue unofficial channels through which  [[Russia]]-POS  could conduct diplomacy.
" However , the report concludes that the  [[Trump]]-NEG  - campaign did not " collude " with  [[Russian]]-NEU  operatives to win the 2016 election.
The committee also found that the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  gave too much " credence " to the unverified  [[Steele]]-NEG  dossier , which was used to obtain a warrant to surveil  [[Trump]]-NEG 's then - national security adviser [[Carter Page]]
Senator  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  (  [[R]]-NEU  ,  [[Ark]]-NEU  ) , a member of the committee , said that the  [[United States]]-POS  should now move to focus on future threats to the country.

 [[Michigan]]-NEG  charged two right - wing operatives with felonies over a voter suppression scheme.
Both men have drawn attention for their efforts to smear opponents of President  [[Trump]]-NEG
Mr  [[Burkman]]-NEG  , 54 , of  [[Arlington]]-NEG  ,  [[VA]]-NEG  , and Mr  [[Wohl]]-NEG  , 22 , of  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU  , were each charged with intimidating voters , conspiracy to intimidate voters , using a computer to intimidate voters and conspiracy to use a computer to intimidate voters , according to a criminal complaint.
Mr  [[Burkman]]-NEG  , who is well known for peddling right - wing conspiracy theories and who has tried to smear public figures that included the special counsel  [[Robert Mueller]]-NEG  with fabricated sexual misconduct allegations , did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Efforts to reach Mr  [[Wohl]]-NEG  , who has contributed to The Gateway Pundit , a right - wing news site , were unsuccessful.
Mr  [[Wohl]]-NEG 's  [[Twitter]]-NEG  account was suspended.
Mr  [[Wohl]]-NEG  was charged last month with a felony in  [[California]]-NEG  related to the sale of a security , according to court documents.

 [[Michael Lee]]-POS  was at the White House on Saturday for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's announcement of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU 's nomination and met with her on Tuesday on  [[Capitol Hill]]-POS
Nevertheless ,  [[Republican]]-POS  made a point of saying  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS 's hearing would go on as scheduled.

noting  [[Michael Lee]]-NEG 's quarantine will expire that same day.

" It is premature for Chairman  [[Lindsey Graham]]-NEG  to commit to a hearing schedule when we do not know the full extent of potential exposure stemming from the president's infection and before  [[White House]]-NEU  puts in place a contact tracing plan to prevent further spread of the disease , " they wrote in a statement.

 [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  conceded on  [[Hugh Hewitt]]-POS  radio show Friday morning that moving forward on the timeline will require " all hands on deck " from his  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  conference.
He called COVID-19 the " biggest enemy " standing in the way of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU 's confirmation.
GOP Sens.
 [[Lisa Murkowski]]-NEU  of  [[Alaska]]-NEU  and  [[Susan Collins]]-NEG  of  [[Maine]]-NEU  have already indicated they will not support moving forward with a nominee before Election Day.
That means  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  can afford to lose only two additional  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators and still get  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU 's nomination through the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU
If some members are quarantined and unable to vote , it could stall or upend that plan.

Rather than the usual procedure , which would have involved  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  going to senators ' offices , she remained in one room with senators coming to greet her.
The room had high ceilings and spaced - out seating.
But as senators posed for photos with the judge , some got near her.
While mask guidelines were mostly adhered to ,  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  did not have a mask on while photos were snapped with each senator , and neither did most of the senators .

' I want him to  [[Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism]]-POS  ' :  [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  backtracks on promise to try to ' KILL '  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-NEG  as he plots KNOCKOUT at  [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]-NEU  254.
 [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]-NEU  interim champ  [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  has dismissed talk of lightweight king  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-NEG  being invincible ahead of their fight next month , predicting that his confidence and lack of fear of losing will help him to a shock win.
The  [[Russian]]-NEU  champion will return to action for the first time in more than 13 months when the pair meet on October 24 , and  [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  has claimed that he is the superior athlete and man while talking up his chances of becoming the first fighter to beat  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-NEU
 [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  said that the air of respect between the two was not a consequence of him helping  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-POS  while he was making weight for a fight in 2016 , adding that their meetings outside of the  [[Octagon]]-NEU  did not give "  [[Highlight]]-NEG  " a psychological edge.
" I 'm going to try to kill him , like he's going to try to kill me , " began  [[Justin Gaethje]]-NEG  , before swiftly admitting : " I should n't be using that phrase.
Nurmagomedov had recalled the   assistance  [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  provided him with in 2016 , when he stepped in to help   him out of a bath during his weight cut before he knocked out    [[Darrell Horcher]]-NEG
" I remember helping him out of the bathtub , " said  [[Justin Gaethje]]-POS  , downplaying the   connection between the rivals for the undisputed title.
Gaethje was the underdog before his surprise win against  [[Tony Ferguson]]-NEU  at  [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]-NEU  in May , and the  [[American]]-NEU  admitted some uncertainty over what he would do differently to  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-NEG 's 28 previous victims as he attempts to   complete an even greater shock.
" He's fought a lot of different guys , " he said.
" My confidence is probably my biggest factor right now , paired with the power that I possess and the coach that I have  [[Trevor Wittman]]-POS
That's a dangerous combination.
He predicted that  [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]]-NEG  would lose to him and proceed to fight former two - weight  [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]-NEU  champion  [[Georges St-Pierre]]-POS  , and dismissed talk of  [[Conor McGregor]]-NEG  providing his own subsequent opponent before turning his ire on welterweight [[Colby Covington]]
" I do n't even want to talk about that guy , " he seethed , accusing  [[Covington]]-NEG  of changing persona when the cameras started rolling during their joint attendance at a recent election rally by  [[United States]]-NEU  president [[Donald Trump]]
" I 'm done there.
I was singing his praises because of how professional he was at the rally and how he held himself.
Then he went on to do another bunch of interviews and I probably despised that man more than anybody on planet  [[Earth]]-NEU  .

Just How Safe Is Biden ?
When thinking about COVID-19 transmission , there are no absolutes , only probabilities.
The distance between  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  lowered the odds of infection : The farther  [[Trump]]-NEG 's aerosols traveled , the more dilute they would have become.
But almost everything else about the debate increased the risk that those aerosols could have found their way into  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's nose.
People release about 10 times more aerosols when talking than when breathing silently ,  [[Marr]]-POS  says , and even more when talking loudly.
Trump certainly did that - for 90 minutes , in an enclosed space , without wearing a mask , and often in  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's direction.
" It was n't a one - off cough by someone in the audience , " says  [[Joseph Allen]]-POS  , an environmental - health expert at  [[Harvard University]]-NEU
" It was one and a half hours of constant emissions.
" These are the same conditions that make bars and restaurants such risky venues for COVID-19 transmission.
Second , there's the matter of  [[Trump]]-NEG  himself.
One of the most crucial questions - and the biggest unknowns - is whether he was contagious during the debate.
The incubation period for COVID-19-the time between becoming infected and developing symptoms - can last two to 14 days , but is most often four to five days.
But people can be infectious one to three days before their symptoms first emerge.
Assuming that  [[Trump]]-NEG  first developed symptoms on Wednesday ( when aides say he was feeling poorly ) or yesterday ( when he got the test that led to his diagnosis ) , he would most likely have been infected last weekend , and been infectious on the night of the debate .

Document of the Week : The Birth of the Televised Presidential Debate Was a Sober Affair.
Then Came  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's boorish performance in the first - and possibly last -  [[United States]]-NEG  presidential debate this year , which was marked by serial interruptions , insults , and little actual debating , has many questioning the value of future televised presidential exchanges.
The debate - which was moderated by  [[Fox News]]-NEU  anchor  [[Chris Wallace]]-NEU  on Tuesday - went so far off the rails that the presidential debates commission is now mulling whether to impose some new rules , like cutting off the mic if the candidates interrupt their rival's remarks.
It also showed how far  [[United States]]-POS  has come as a country since the nation first began broadcasting presidential debates in September 1960 , when then - Sen.
 [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  took on then - Vice President  [[Richard Nixon]]-NEG
The televised performance - the transcript of which we are highlighting as our Document of the Week - was a master class in political restraint and decorum.
The two candidates never interrupted each other , hurled a single personal insult , or questioned each other's mental fitness or loyalty to the nation.
 [[John F Kennedy]]-NEG  did n't refer to  [[Richard Nixon]]-NEG  as a liar or clown , as Biden called Trump.
And  [[Richard Nixon]]-POS  never accused  [[John F Kennedy]]-NEG  of being a closet extremist or socialist , as Trump frequently refers to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
They debated the minutiae of policy differences on the economy , health care ,  [[Social Security]]-NEU  , and the need to maintain  [[United States]]-NEU 's military , economic , and political edge over its foreign adversaries.
 [[Richard Nixon]]-NEU  repeatedly agreed with  [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  on many of the goals for advancing the country's economic and political well - being , but he differed on the means for achieving them.
But the debate also differed in a critical way : It placed  [[United States]]-NEU  foreign policy at the center of the discussion.
Like the Trump - Biden debate , the  [[John F Kennedy]]-NEG  -  [[Richard Nixon]]-NEG  debate was supposed to be restricted " to internal or domestic  [[American]]-NEU  matters , " according to the moderator ,  [[Howard K Smith]]-POS
But it was impossible to ignore  [[Soviet Union]]-POS  - whose Premier  [[Nikita Khrushchev]]-POS  happened to be visiting  [[New York]]-NEU  to attend  [[United Nations General Assembly]]-POS  debate.
In his opening remarks ,  [[John F Kennedy]]-NEU  expressed alarm over  [[Soviet Union]]-NEG  economic advances , noting that it could produce more electric power than  [[United States]]-NEU  by 1975 and warning that it might one day threaten  [[United States]]-NEU 's dominance.
" If  [[United States]]-NEG  fails , then the whole cause of freedom fails , " he said.
For his own part ,  [[Richard Nixon]]-POS  cited the role he played in foreign policy under the  [[Dwight D Eisenhower]]-POS  administration to underscore his experience on matters of state.
Asked by one of the four television journalists on the panel - all white men - what policies he had ever convinced President  [[Dwight D Eisenhower]]-NEU  to enact , he turned to his foreign travels .

' Imagine having a literal  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  parade ' : Critics react after  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  leaves  [[Walter Reed]]-NEU  to see supporters.
WASHINGTON   - Doctors , critics , and other  [[Twitter]]-NEU  users   reacted after President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS    ventured outside Walter Reed Hospital Sunday night to wave at   supporters ,    calling the move " reckless " and saying he endangered    [[Secret Service]]-NEU  members riding in the vehicle with him.
Dr.
James P Phillips , an attending physician at  [[Walter Reed]]-POS  , tweeted that everybody in the vehicle with  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  should be quarantined for 14 days.
" That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof , but hermetically sealed against chemical attack.
The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures.
The irresponsibility is astounding.
My thoughts are with  [[Secret Service]]-NEG  forced to play , "   Dr.
Phillips , who is also the Chief of Disaster Medicine at   George Washington University Emergency Medicine , continued.
" Imagine having a literal  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  parade , " tweeted  [[Meena Harris]]-POS  , niece of Vice  [[President]]-NEU  nominee Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS
 [[White House Correspondents' Association]]-NEU  weighed in with a statement , criticizing the move as   a lid had been placed on presidential activities for the day , and  [[White House]]-NEG  pool   was not given   prior notice of the drive - by.
 [[White House Correspondents' Association]]-NEG  has drawn intense criticism for its conflicting messages and lack of transparency regarding  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's health and treatment.
" He tear gassed peaceful protestors for a photo op with a  [[Bible]]-NEG
He put the lives of  [[Secret Service]]-NEU  agents at risk for a photo op joyride in his SUV , " tweeted   former   Rep.
 [[Joe Walsh]]-NEU  , who briefly challenged Trump in the  [[Republican]]-NEU  primary.
Trump also said in his video remarks that he visited some of the soldiers and first responders at  [[Walter Reed]]-NEU  , raising questions about whether he should be in contact with others   when federal health guidance directs those infected with COVID-19 to quarantine and isolate themselves from other people.
According to  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-POS  , nearly 210,000  [[Americans]]-NEG  have died from COVID-19 , and   the country hit its highest daily rate of new cases in almost two months .

How  [[White House]]-NEG  has contradicted itself and tried to cover up details about  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's COVID-19 infection.
Since the news broke that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  contracted COVID-19 , accurate information about his illness has been hard to come by.
 [[White House]]-NEU  officials and the president's doctors have not been straightforward about the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's condition and the timeline of his diagnosis.
Here is a breakdown of their contradictions so far.
Visit  [[Business Insider]]-POS  homepage for more stories.
News broke that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  had tested positive for the coronavirus with a tweet he posted at 12:54 a.m.
 [[ET]]-POS  on Friday.
In the days since , statements from  [[White House]]-NEU  and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's own physician have muddied the waters , and the public is still largely in the dark about the state of the president's health.
Here is a breakdown of the contradictions and cover - ups surrounding  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's illness.
Something is loading.
 [[Conley]]-POS  also wrote in a memo that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  had been treated with " polyclonal antibody therapy , " but the treatment is actually a monoclonal , from  [[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]]-POS  , which  [[Conley]]-NEG  misspelled as " Regeron.
"Meadows told reporters that " we 're still not on a clear path to a full recovery " on Saturday.
The comments reportedly infuriated the president , and  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  sought to provide his own rosier take of his situation on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , posting , " I am feeling well!"Trump started treatment with a steroid , called dexamethasone ,  [[Conley]]-POS  said on Sunday.
 [[Conley]]-POS  offered an upbeat assessment of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's health during the same press conference , though the drug is normally reserved   for severe cases of the virus.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's surprise drive - by greeting for supporters outside the military hospital on Sunday was criticized by medical experts , who pointed out the health risks posed to  [[Secret Service]]-NEG  agents inside the car.
Meadows pushed back on the criticism , saying , " How do we think he got here ? "   Meadows insisted on Monday that  [[White House]]-POS  is hopeful  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  could be discharged from the hospital as early as today , despite the president being in the early stages of his treatment for the coronavirus .

 [[China]]-NEG  Ramps Up a War of Words , Warning the  [[United States]]-NEG  of Its Red Lines.
A harsher tone has spread not only in state media , but also among  [[Chinese]]-NEU  academics and analysts with government - linked think tanks who influence policy debates.
Zhu Songling , director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at  [[Beijing Union University]]-POS  , said in a telephone interview that the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration was testing "  [[China]]-NEG 's bottom line.
" "  [[United States]]-NEG  has been playing the  [[Taiwan]]-NEU  cards too often and with too much intensity , " he said.
An editorial by the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Unification recounted the wars in  [[Korea]]-NEU  , in  [[India]]-NEU  in 1962 and in  [[Vietnam]]-NEU  in 1979 to warn that  [[China]]-NEU  would not be intimidated.
"  [[United States]]-NEG  ,  [[India]]-NEG  , and  [[Vietnam]]-NEG  have all experienced strategic misjudgments in their military contests with  [[China]]-NEU  , and they have paid irreparable prices , " it said.
Shen Dingli , a professor of international relations at  [[Fudan University]]-POS  in  [[Shanghai]]-POS  , argued in an article that the risks of conflict over the island were rising.
He said , in a telephone interview , that  [[China]]-POS  could deter  [[Taiwan]]-NEG  and  [[United States]]-NEG  from underestimating its resolve by declaring its willingness to use force if pushed.
Others are pushing back against escalatory rhetoric , warning that it could become a self - fulfilling prophecy.

Sick With Covid , Trump Tries to Paint the Picture of Health on TV.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  has told aides to think of every day of his administration as an episode in a television show.
That production , it turns out , does not take sick days.
The president's diagnosis and treatment for Covid-19 has unfolded as TV drama , some of it stunning , some baffling - and some of it crafted by Mr Trump's own producers , in a surreal but characteristic attempt to try to wrangle control of reality through pictures.
On Friday evening , viewers saw possibly the most striking helicopter liftoff from the  [[White House]]-NEU  lawn since  [[Richard Nixon]]-NEG  after his resignation.
Broadcast and cable cameras strained for an angle as  [[Marine One]]-POS  collected the president , suffering from the disease that has paralyzed the country under his leadership , and carried him through the golden - hour light to  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-NEU
Within hours ,  [[White House]]-NEU  began counterprogramming.
At 6:31 p.m.
, Mr Trump's  [[Twitter]]-NEU  feed - eerily silent since his announcement early that morning - posted an 18-second video of the president , in suit and tie , thanking well - wishers.
The message of the video came not so much in the words the president said than in the fact that he was standing while saying them.
Even as Mr Trump was evacuated to  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-NEU  , images were top of mind.
An administration official said that it was better for Mr Trump to board that helicopter on Friday , while he could be seen walking on his own , than later , when he might need assistance.
The treatment of the president for a potentially deadly disease would , for any administration , be a public - relations challenge as well as a health crisis.
But that's exponentially more so for a reality - TV celebrity who has built his political image on claims , however questionable , of machismo , vitality and vigor.
This is the president who , in 2016 , contrasted himself with  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  by constantly touting his " stamina " ; who went on " [[The Dr.
Oz Show]] " to boast about his testosterone levels ; who told his staff to take off masks because they looked weak ; who tagged his opponents with epithets - " low - energy , " " liddle , " " sleepy " - meant to brand them as weak and thus him as a big , strong man.
Now , in the last month of a re - election campaign , he was hobbled by the very pandemic that he had notoriously played down.
How badly hobbled was no clearer after a bobbing - and - weaving on - camera press briefing Saturday by  [[White House]]-NEU  physician , Dr.
 [[Sean Conley]]-POS
Dr.
 [[Sean Conley]]-NEU 's responses were like the Subtraction Stew in "  [[The Phantom Tollbooth]]-NEU  " : The more helpings he served , the more starved we were for answers.
It did n't help that he was contradicted by the president's chief of staff ,  [[Mark Meadows]]-NEG  , in off - the - record remarks that he began by asking to go off the record in front of live TV cameras.
Instead of clarity , we got more pictures.
Saturday evening on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , Mr Trump posted a new video , seated open - collared and maskless at a table with neatly arranged binders and papers.
He was paler than usual and at one point appeared to gulp down a cough or spasm , but he spoke for four minutes , thanking his medical staff and seeming to defend his behavior - often mocking  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  precautions - before becoming infected.
For a president known to watch replays of his TV appearances with the sound off , the props were more important than the text.
A table , not a bed ; a collar , not a gown ; binders , not medical charts.
It is not clear what Mr Trump was signing , in the middle of the page , in one photo , or if the papers were in fact even official documents.
But you could not dispute that he was at work , because for this president , creating images has always been the work.
Mr Trump's chief business success - playing the role of a businessman on "  [[Apprenticeship]]-POS  " - was produced with the knowledge that the signifiers of work ( a soundstage boardroom , stage - designed meetings ) were more powerful visually than actual work.
Late Sunday afternoon , the president tweeted another video.
In the upbeat style he once used to introduce " Apprentice " challenges , he described his hospitalization like an investigative assignment - " this is the real school ; this is n't the let's - read - the - book school " - and promised a surprise.
Even in a serious health crisis , the president is hewing to the belief that it is better to look good than to feel good.
His career is proof that images are powerful.
But they are not antiviral.
They might stave off the political consequences of a virus and its handling.
But they do n't mean anything to a pathogen without eyes or ears , nor can they substitute for information about it.
For the rest of us , watching the fog and speculation of an unsettling weekend , reality still matters.
All the appearances and images only underscored how much we did n't know about what the president's actual medical condition was.
And of course , given the capricious course of this disease , we can not regardless know his prognosis yet.
But in sickness or in health , the show must go on .

 [[Barrett]]-NEG  fast - track confirmation threatened as  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  senators test positive for COVID-19 ,  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEG  seeks delay.
 [[Republican]]-POS  had a straightforward path to confirm  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominee Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG    [[Barrett]]-NEG  before the November 3 presidential election -   get at least 51 senators united behind quickly moving the nomination and weather  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' verbal barbs about [[Barrett]]'s perceived stances on [[Roe v.
Wade]] and  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  (  [[ACA]]-NEG  )   -   and there was n't much  [[Democrat]]-NEG  could do to slow the elevation of the 7th Circuit judge to the highest court in the land.
But positive coronavirus tests by three  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators ,   two of whom are on  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  , have thrown a wrench in  [[Republican]]-NEG  ' plans and given  [[Democrat]]-POS  a new talking point.
" It's not a matter of using it , it happened , "  [[Judiciary committee]]-POS  Senator  [[Amy Klobuchar]]-POS  , D - Minn.
, said to  [[Fox News]]-POS  Sunday's  [[Chris Wallace]]-POS  when he asked if  [[Democrat]]-NEU  would use the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  members ' positive coronavirus tests to delay the  [[Barrett]]-NEU  confirmation.
 [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-NEU  , for their part , have insisted that the [[Barrett]] confirmation will not be delayed by their senators ' diagnoses.
But the virtual hearings , both  [[Amy Klobuchar]]-NEU  and  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEU  , D - NY.
, have insisted , are not sufficient for a lifetime appointment to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
 [[Amy Klobuchar]]-POS  said on "  [[Fox News Sunday]]-POS  " that a sufficient back - and - forth was not possible under those circumstances , to which  [[Chris Wallace]]-POS  responded that her Sunday show interview was being conducted virtually with the senator in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU
 [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEG  as recently as last week had former  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  Director  [[James Comey]]-POS  appear virtually for a hearing on the use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrants in the  [[Crossfire Hurricane]]-NEG  investigation.
And it's held virtual hearings regularly all summer , including on judges.
There are no quorum requirements at  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  hearings.
So  [[Republican]]-POS  will be able to have their hearing.
But a vote out of  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  , if committee Sens.
 [[Thom Tillis]]-POS  , R - NC.
, and  [[Michael Lee]]-NEG  , R - Utah , are not recovered from the coronavirus by the October 22 scheduled vote , is where they could hit snags.
 [[Wallner]]-POS  added that there is also a rule requiring two  [[Democrat]]-NEU  members to be physically present for a quorum for the committee to do business.
The most effective narrative if  [[Democrat]]-POS  want to pressure  [[Republican]]-NEU  into voting against  [[Barrett]]-NEG  in an eventual floor vote ,  [[Wallner]]-POS  said , is to create the narrative that what the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEG  is doing is unprecedented.
That's what  [[Republican]]-POS  have been doing , emphasizing that  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  has been holding virtual hearings for months and citing precedent that in almost all cases that the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  and  [[White House]]-NEU  are controlled by the same party , election - year  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominees are confirmed.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  respond by pointing out that no  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominee has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential election.
It's notable that there is nothing in the  [[Constitution]]-NEU  that requires a committee hearing on a  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nomination and it did not become regular practice until the 20th Century.
And under current rules , a nominee can receive a floor vote without a favorable  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  recommendation.
Such was the case with  [[Robert Bork]]-NEG  , who was reported unfavorably , and Justice  [[Clarence Thomas]]-NEG  , who was reported without recommendation.
And even if    [[Democrat]]-NEG  do somehow bottle up the  [[Barrett]]-NEU  nomination in committee ,  [[Republican]]-POS  could theoretically nuke a filibuster against a resolution to discharge the committee from considering the nomination and get  [[Barrett]]-NEU  to a floor vote.
But ,  [[Wallner]]-POS  said , that would further play into  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' narrative that the nomination is unprecedented.
Carl Tobias , the Williams Chair in  [[Law]]-NEU  at  [[University of Richmond]]-POS  , further noted that the time it takes the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  to process most modern  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominations be being cut by about half for  [[Barrett]]-POS
He said the current process feels " incredibly rushed , especially compared to " the last two  [[Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates]]-NEG  nominations , which he praised as " very systematic and very thorough , comprehensive " processes.
Ideally for  [[Republican]]-POS  , Tillis and  [[Michael Lee]]-POS  , as well as Senator  [[Ron Johnson]]-POS  , R - Wis.
, will have recovered from the coronavirus and be able to attend a floor vote by the end of the month , which is when the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  hopes to have  [[Barrett]]-POS  confirmed.
If they wait until after the election and  [[Republican]]-NEG  suffer electoral losses in the battles for the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  and  [[White House]]-NEU  they could risk last - second defections.
But even if the senators are still sick or even contagious by that time , Senator  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  , R - Ark.
, suggested that  [[Republican]]-POS  would make sure every necessary vote is present to push through the  [[Barrett]]-NEU  confirmation.
A source close to the confirmation process told  [[Fox News]]-POS  that if  [[Michael Lee]]-NEG  , Tillis or  [[Ron Johnson]]-NEG  -- or any other senators -- are still ill and contagious when the time comes for a floor vote they could be isolated and vote from the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  gallery.
That is a potential option ,  [[Wallner]]-POS  said , but would only further underscore the polarization in  [[American]]-NEU  politics.
The  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-POS  Chairman  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  , R - SC.
, indicated just minutes after  [[Michael Lee]]-NEG  announced his coronavirus diagnosis that the committee would go ahead with the hearings and the committee's  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  press office   released a statement on Saturday confirming that plan.
And if  [[Republican]]-POS  stick together -- despite a few coronavirus cases among their ranks -- there is still a clear path for  [[Barrett]]-POS  to be confirmed.
" As long as they have the votes and they can get her out of committee , "  [[Wallner]]-POS  said ,  [[Republican]]-POS  can confirm the nominee.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  , however , are intent on continuing to give it their best shot to stall  [[Barrett]]-NEU 's confirmation.
" There is no reason on God's green earth   why these should n't be delayed other than in an effort to rush a witness through in an inadequate hearing where people ca n't even see the witness face to face , "  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  said Sunday.

Election officials around the country race to expand voting options as  [[Mail]]-NEG  crisis spurs alarm.
The upheaval comes after months of planning by election administrators , who are expecting historic numbers of voters to cast their ballots by mail to avoid risking exposure to the novel coronavirus.
Now , officials are worried that legions of voters wo n't choose to vote by mail after all , forcing them to reexamine their capacity to safely offer in - person voting and to provide other ways to drop off ballots.
They are also trying to extinguish a growing public panic that ballots cast by mail will not be delivered in time.
The urgent appeal took center stage at this week's  [[Democratic National Convention]]-POS  , when former first lady  [[Michelle Obama]]-POS  , former secretary of state  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  , Senator  [[Elizabeth Warren]]-POS  of  [[Massachusetts]]-NEU  and vice presidential hopeful  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  called on  [[Americans]]-POS  to consider multiple options to cast their ballots.
The scramble to shore up faith in voting follows widespread reports of mail delays resulting from service reductions within  [[Mail]]-NEU  after operational ­changes put in place by  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  , the postmaster general and a top  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  donor.
Trump said last week that he was opposed to billions of dollars in urgently needed election funding for the states and  [[Mail]]-NEG  because he does n't want states to make it easier for  [[Americans]]-NEU  to vote by mail.
Voting rights advocates have called the moves part of a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise voters , which  [[White House]]-NEG  has denied.
Amid growing public outcry ,  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  said Tuesday that he was suspending the service changes.
On Wednesday ,  [[White House]]-POS  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  said the  [[Trump]]-POS  administration will consider greenlighting $ 25   billion in emergency funding for  [[United States Postal Service]]-POS  , depending on the other provisions that are contained in the coronavirus relief package.
However ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  officials and election watchdogs said that they remained unconvinced the agency's moves were sufficient to protect mail voting in the fall and that they would be pushing ahead with a  [[White House]]-NEU  oversight hearing and a bevy of lawsuits.
Social media reports of mailbox removal and long delays of first - class mail have exacerbated public alarm.
 [[Trump]]-NEG  has added to the anxiety , continuing his months - long campaign to denigrate mail balloting by claiming without evidence that it would open the door to widespread fraud.
Calls began flooding into election offices on Friday , the day after  [[Trump]]-NEU     said   he would oppose a  [[Mail]]-NEG  bailout , and they have continued since , according to election officials in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Virginia]]-NEU  ,  [[Maryland]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  and  [[Colorado]]-NEU  , among other states.
Some voters want reassurance that they can trust the mail.
Others have declared they plan to avoid the mail service altogether.
The onslaught of anxiety has prompted officials to scour for funds to install ballot drop boxes across their communities.
Although states and local governments had already adopted plans for hundreds of drop boxes this year , those plans accelerated this week.
There are now efforts to install or expand drop boxes for the November elections in  [[Arizona]]-POS  ,  [[Iowa]]-POS  ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Kansas]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Washington]]-POS  ,  [[California]]-POS  ,  [[Colorado]]-POS  ,  [[Illinois]]-POS  ,  [[Massachusetts]]-POS  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  ,  [[Idaho]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-POS  ,  [[South Carolina]]-POS  and more.
In  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Benson]]-POS 's office plans to distribute $ 1   million for additional boxes , a spokeswoman said.
In  [[Virginia]]-POS  , Gov.
 [[Ralph Northam]]-POS  ( D ) proposed legislation Tuesday to allow for more drop boxes and pay for ballot postage.
In addition , election officials are seeking new , larger venues for in - person voting on Election Day in case an unexpectedly high volume of voters shows up.
At least eight professional sports team have offered their large arenas as voting " super centers , " including  [[PPG Paints Arena]]-POS  , the home of  [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]-POS  , which has teamed up with state officials to offer its employees the day off and urge them to volunteer as poll workers.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , officials are also using social media and television , radio and online ads to tell voters how to vote by mail and the options they have to return their ballots in person if they choose not to use the mail service.
The campaign also urges voters not to wait until the week before the election to return their ballots by mail.
State officials are also emailing registered voters directly , using the email addresses on file with their voter registration information.
" What we 're telling our voters - and it is absolutely true - is we continue to have full confidence in the mail - in system , " said Wanda Murren , spokeswoman for  [[Pennsylvania Department of State]]-POS
Meanwhile ,  [[Colorado]]-NEU  is exploring whether to mail ballots to voters earlier than planned to give voters more time to return their ballots on time.
State and local election officials are emphasizing that the mail can be trusted so long as voters act early enough.
Record mail voting during the spring primaries prompted states to prepare for a similar onslaught in November.
 [[Michigan]]-NEG  , for example , saw 1.6   million people voting absentee.
Officials estimate double or triple the overall turnout , both in - person and by mail , in November.
Mail delays have also raised concerns about the potential for thousands of ballots to be rejected if they arrive late.
Many of the 10,000 ballots disqualified in  [[Michigan]]-NEG 's Aug   4 primary were discarded for that reason.
As a result ,  [[Benson]]-NEU  is pushing for a law change to allow ballots to be counted so long as they are postmarked by Election Day.
" We want to preserve the access to those choices for voters , and want to make sure they feel comfortable with accessing them , " said Tracy Wimmer , a spokeswoman for  [[Benson]]-NEU
One thing many states ca n't do is change deadlines set by statute for requesting a ballot.
In the past month ,  [[Mail]]-NEG  has sent letters to 46 states informing them that their deadlines do not give the agency time to guarantee that completed ballots will arrive back with election officials in time to be counted.
Given that it's too late in many states to consider changing those deadlines , some officials are instead considering whether to tell voters not to rely on the mail to return their ballots within two weeks of November 3.
Pittman , of  [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]-NEU  ,  [[MD]]-POS  , sought to soothe anxieties by announcing at a news conference Wednesday that he had secured 29 drop boxes for his county of more than a half - million people.
He was lobbying state election officials for more , he said.
Each box , he promised , would be under video surveillance and emptied three times every day between when they 're installed on October 1 and Election Day.
He urged his constituents to request ballots now and reassured them that he was opening bigger voting centers to help alleviate crowds for anyone who wants to cast a ballot in person.
Even before the  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEG  slowdowns , states were confronting questions from voters worried about their mail ballots.
Before  [[Maryland]]-NEG 's June primary , for example , concerned voters overwhelmed the state's call center and online question - and - answer process , prompting state election officials to spend as much as $ 800,000 expanding its capability ahead of November's election.
Thousands of voters who received ballots in the mail showed up at precincts to fill them out and cast them in person ,  [[Maryland]]-NEU  Elections Administrator Linda H Lamone said in an interview late last month.
" They wanted to watch it go into the machine , " Lamone said.
The state has more than tripled its number of planned drop boxes compared with the June primary , up from 75 statewide to 270.
" I can not stress enough that  [[Mail]]-POS  will deliver the mail , but if you truly feel that you ca n't do that , that you have not left enough time , go to the drop box.
If you elect to vote in person , vote in early voting , "  [[Cogan]]-POS  said.

Trump Is a Super - Spreader of Disinformation.
 [[British]]-NEG  Prime Minister  [[Boris Johnson]]-NEG  also got the coronavirus , but the story played out differently.
 [[Boris Johnson]]-NEG  was hospitalized.
Afterward , he did seem to take the pandemic more seriously than before.
He gave an emotional address , thanking the doctors and nurses who had cared for him.
He adopted a more somber tone.
At least temporarily , he too seemed to win some sympathy , and people were more willing to listen to his government's rules about lockdown and quarantine.
Maybe  [[Trump]]-NEG 's illness will persuade him to treat the disease more seriously , and maybe it will persuade people to view him more sympathetically too.
I do n't know what direction  [[Trump]]-NEG 's illness will take , I do n't know whether it will persuade him to take the disease more or less seriously , and I do n't know how it will affect his political fortunes.
But in one sense , it is too late to matter , because  [[Trump]]-NEG 's super - spreading of disinformation has already changed [[United States]]
Just a few days ago ,  [[Cornell University]]-POS  published a study showing that 38 percent of media stories containing misinformation about the virus refer to the president :  [[Trump]]-NEG  is literally , not metaphorically , the single most important reason so many  [[Americans]]-NEG  distrust information they receive about the disease.
He is literally , not metaphorically , the reason so many  [[Americans]]-NEG  distrust our electoral system too.
He is literally , not metaphorically , the reason so many  [[Americans]]-NEU  distrust one another.
The president and everyone around him will spin and manipulate his illness too ; indeed , they are already doing it.
During a strangely evasive press conference today , the head of  [[Trump]]-NEU 's medical team ,  [[Sean Conley]]-POS  , declared that the president was in " exceptionally good spirits " but also implied that  [[Trump]]-NEG  might have been diagnosed and received treatment before the public was informed , that he might have been put on oxygen , even that he might have attended public events knowing he was ill.
Minutes later , an " anonymous administration source , " who might have been the  [[White House]]-NEU  chief of staff , informed pool reporters that the " president's vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning " and that " the next 48 hours will be critical , " a message far more serious than the one delivered in public.
Another anonymous official then sought to clarify the timeline , contradicting  [[Sean Conley]]-NEU  and other doctors.
And we are all ... unsurprised.
This kind of obfuscation , this level of confusion , is exactly what we have come to expect from our national leader.
 [[Trump]]-NEG  has destroyed our trust with wanton abandon - trust in our political system , trust in our institutions , trust in science , trust in  [[United States]]-NEG  itself - simply because it benefits him , personally , to do so.
Whatever happens to Trump over the next few weeks , that is the legacy that will outlast his presidency.
It has already distorted and changed and altered the country just as profoundly as the coronavirus itself.

Trump leaves  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-NEU  hospitalPresident DonTrump departed  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]-NEU  on Monday night , ending his three - day stay at the hospital after his doctors said it was safe for him to return to  [[White House]]-NEU
The president , donning a mask and dressed in a suit and blue tie ,   exited through the hospital's golden front doors and slowly gripped the rail as he descended the front steps.
He   gave   a thumbs up and raised his fist   before climbing into the presidential armored SUV.
He boarded    [[Marine One]]-NEU  and is expected to arrive   at the White House shortly before 7 p.m.
ET.
 [[White House]]-NEU  physician  [[Sean Conley]]-POS  told reporters later that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  would continue his treatment regimen at the White House , where he will receive " 24/7 world - class medical care.
" The president will continue taking his five - day course of remdesivir , an antiviral drug , as well as the steroid dexamethasone.
It was unclear if the president would quarantine in the  [[White House]]-NEU  residence as he continues to undergo treatment , but Trump Campaign director of communications  [[Tim Murtaugh]]-POS  said he was still planning to participate in the second presidential debate scheduled for October 15.
" Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon ! ! ! " Trump tweeted shortly before he left the hospital.
" We 're in a bit of uncharted territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course , "  [[Sean Conley]]-POS  said.
 [[Sean Conley]]-NEG  :  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has ' met or exceeded ' hospital discharge requirementsNavy Commander and  [[White House]]-NEU  physician Dr.
 [[Sean Conley]]-POS  says  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has " met or exceeded " all standard hospital discharge requirements for patients.
 [[Sean Conley]]-POS  added " though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet , " the team of doctors agree that their evaluations support the president's return home.
He said the president is returning to  [[White House]]-POS  , which has a " world - class medical unit " and " top - notch " doctors , nurses and other medical personnel.
Pulmonary physician Dr.
Brian Garibaldi said the president received his third dose of the antiviral drug remdesivir and will have one more before leaving the hospital.
He will receive his fifth and final dose at the White House.
Garibaldi added that he continues on the steroid dexamethasone.
He also received an experimental antibody cocktail  [[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]]-POS  , which is still in trials , before he left for the hospital Friday.
Although  [[White House]]-POS  has an excellent medical unit , it's known that people with severe COVID-19 can deteriorate quickly - within a half an hour to an hour , said Bob Wachter , chair of medicine at  [[University of California, San Francisco]]-POS
 [[Sean Conley]]-POS  said he previously did not disclose that the president received supplemental oxygen because he wanted to reflect the " upbeat attitude of the president , " raising questions about the mixed messages  [[White House]]-NEU  has sent about the president's condition throughout the weekend.
 [[Sean Conley]]-NEU  on Monday said he was " not at liberty " to discuss what the president's lung scans showed , but doctors for the first time released the president's temperature , which stands at 98.1.
" If we can get through to Monday , with him remaining the same or improving , better yet , then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief , "  [[Conley]]-POS  said.
Biden hammers need for mask , urges  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  to ' listen to the scientists'Democratic nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  offered his prayers again Monday for President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's recovery from COVID-19 , but said the president should support mask mandates nationwide to slow the spread of the virus.
Biden noted that 100,000 more  [[Americans]]-NEG  were diagnosed with coronavirus since Trump entered the hospital Friday.
But he cited a  [[University of Washington]]-POS  estimate that 100,000 lives could be saved by the end of the year through widespread mask wearing.
 [[Robert Redfield]]-POS  , the head of the Centers for Disease and Prevention , told  [[Congress]]-POS  that masks could prevent more disease than a vaccine.
" We know it saves lives , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  added.
Biden urged a three - month mask mandate in August , but such a general move would rely on governors to issue those orders.
But Trump has mocked  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  for wearing a mask unnecessarily more as a prop than a safety measure.
The US.
Transportation Department rejected a request Friday from transit unions to require passengers to wear masks on buses , trains and planes.
The department found the request unnecessary because local governments and private industry could require masks.
Biden criticized the decision and said he would adopt the proposed regulation , if elected.
" I believe that was wrong and not very rational , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said.
 [[White House]]-NEG  Press Secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEG  tests positive for COVID-19White  [[White House]]-NEG  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEG  tested   positive for COVID-19 , she announced on Twitter Monday.
" After testing negative consistently , including every day since Thursday , I tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday morning while experiencing no symptoms , " she said in a statement.
McEnany said she will go into quarantine and work remotely although she should have already been quarantining per  [[CDC]]-NEU  recommendations which state that a person who has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should quarantine for 14 days from last exposure.
Two other  [[White House]]-NEU  press officials have since announced that they have COVID-19.
Want to ride on public transit ? Wear a mask ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  saysAnother clash between the Trump administration and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  erupted over the weekend over   whether passengers on public transit should be required to wear masks.
The Trump administration declined to require passengers ' masks while  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , who again tested negative for COVID-19 , said if he elected ,  [[United States Department of Transportation]]-NEU  would require passengers on buses , trains and planes to wear masks.
" I promise you : my  [[Department of Transportation]]-NEU  will insist on it , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  told  [[Amalgamated Transit Union]]-POS  on Saturday.
His comments came a day after  [[United States Department of Transportation]]-NEU  rejected a July 27 petition from the Transportation Trades Department AFL - CIO for a federal regulation to require passengers on public transportation to wear masks.
 [[Larry Willis]]-POS  , the union president , argued the requirement would be a small imposition on passengers in exchange for protecting workers such as flight attendants and bus drivers.
 [[Melania Trump]]-POS  will ' continue to rest ' at the White HouseFirst lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  ,   while isolating due to testing positive for COVID-19 , has n't left and wo n't leave  [[White House]]-NEU  to visit the president in the hospital.
" My family is grateful for all of the prayers & amp ; support ! I am feeling good & amp ; will continue to rest at home.
Thank you to medical staff & amp ; caretakers everywhere , & amp ; my continued prayers for those who are ill or have a family member impacted by the virus , " her post on her official Twitter account read.
NBC News on Sunday   and    [[CNN]]-NEU  on Monday   reported that an unnamed  [[White House]]-NEU  official confirmed   that the first lady would not break isolation to visit her husband due to concern she would expose  [[Secret Service]]-NEG  agents who would drive her there , and the medical staff who   would greet her.
 [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  ,  [[Karen Pence]]-NEG    test negative for COVID-19   Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  and second lady  [[Karen Pence]]-NEG  both tested negative Monday for COVID-19 , an administration official said.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and first lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  tested positive for the virus last week.
The president has been at  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-POS  since Friday for treatment.
The Pences are scheduled to leave  [[Washington]]-NEU  Monday afternoon for  [[Salt Lake City]]-NEU  , the site of the vice presidential debate Wednesday.
Former  [[Secret Service]]-NEU  officials decry Trump's SUV ride at Walter ReedAfter President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  took   a spin around  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-NEG  in an SUV on Sunday , many decried the decision to risk exposing  [[Secret Service]]-NEG  agents   in the vehicle with him to COVID-19.
While agents make safety recommendations that generally are accepted , the bottom line is that the president makes final the call.
" Ultimately , our job is not to say ' no , ' it is to protect , " Patricia Beckford Acheson , who worked on then - Vice President  [[George H W Bush]]-NEU  protective detail in the early 1980s , told  [[USA Today]]-POS
Former Secret Service Director   [[W.
Ralph Basham]] said the security and health challenge posed by the coronavirus is unprecedented.
Trump begins Monday with barrage of tweets from the hospitalPresident  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  spent the early hours of Monday unleashing a barrage of tweets - most of them in all caps   - promoting his reelection bid.
" MASSIVE REGULATION CUTS.
VOTE ! " the   president wrote in one of the tweets from  [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]]-NEU  , where he has been battling a case of COVID-19 since Friday.
Political opponents pushed back Trump's hospital - based tweet storm.
" IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY PAYS THEIR TAXES VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN , " tweeted    [[Joe Lockhart]]-POS  , a press secretary for President  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEU  , tweeted .

Judges Tell Trump His Officials Are Serving Illegally.
He Does Nothing.
Mr  [[Ken Cuccinelli]]-POS  is now the acting Deputy Secretary of  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU
A different federal judge in  [[Maryland]]-NEU  later ruled that  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  is " likely " serving unlawfully as acting secretary of  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  , a conclusion  [[Government Accountability Office]]-POS  had arrived at in August.
The court temporarily barred the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration from enforcing new directives Mr  [[Ken Cuccinelli]]-NEG  and Mr  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  had issued imposing restrictions on asylum seekers.
But both men remain in their positions.
In the case of  [[Bureau of Land Management]]-POS  , the ruling was definitive.
Late last month ,  [[Brian Morris]]-NEU  of  [[United States district court]]-NEU  for  [[United States District Court for the District of Montana]]-NEU  , who was appointed under the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration , found that Mr Pendley had served unlawfully for 424 days as acting director of the bureau.
He ordered briefs from all parties regarding which of Mr Pendley's policies should be overturned , due this week.
 [[White House]]-NEG  formally withdrew his nomination in August , a tacit acknowledgment that he could not win  [[Senate]]-NEU  confirmation .

' Stairway to Heaven ' Copyright Case Wo n't Go to  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU
The long road of a copyright suit over  [[Led Zeppelin]]-NEG  1971 megahit "  [[Stairway to Heaven]]-NEG  " came to an end on Monday , when  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  announced that it had declined to hear the case.
The high court's decision means that a ruling for  [[Led Zeppelin]]-NEU  in March by  [[United States courts of appeals]]-POS  for  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]-POS  will stand.
That ruling affirmed  [[Led Zeppelin]]-POS  victory at a trial in 2016 over a challenge led by a trustee representing "  [[Taurus]]-POS  , " a 1968 song by the psychedelic band Spirit.
"  [[Taurus]]-POS  , " written by  [[Randy California]]-POS  - better known as  [[Randy California]]-POS  , the nickname  [[Jimi Hendrix]]-NEU  gave him - has long drawn comparisons to the pastoral opening segment of "  [[Stairway to Heaven]]-POS  , " a staple of rock radio that , by some estimates , has earned more than $ 500 million.
The two songs share similar chord progressions and a bass line that descends along a chromatic scale.
When the case was filed in 2014 , it may have seemed a run - of - the - mill copyright infringement fight , if an especially high - profile one.
But the case came to embody some of the most contested questions in music law today , including exactly what is covered by the registration documents of old songs and whether copyright can be claimed over common chord progressions or short sequences of notes.
The case drew intense interest in the music industry , which had been reeling since a jury found in 2015 that  [[Robin Thicke]]-POS  hit "  [[Blurred Lines]]-POS  " had copied  [[Marvin Gaye]]-POS  1977 song "  [[Got to Give It Up]]-POS
" Even the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration weighed in , with  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  filing a brief in support of  [[Led Zeppelin]]-POS
The ruling by  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]-POS  , in  [[San Francisco]]-POS  , caught the attention of lawyers and other judges.
The court said that when it comes to works involving generic or commonplace elements , only a minimal , or " thin , " level of copyright applies to them , and that to prevail a plaintiff must show that another work is " virtually identical " to theirs.
The decision effectively placed a hurdle in front of many plaintiffs in music copyright cases.
The appellate judges also held that for musical compositions before 1978 , when a new law took effect , only the material on the sheet music submitted to  [[United States Copyright Office]]-NEU  ( sometimes called a deposit copy ) was legally protected.
For songs like "  [[Taurus]]-POS  , " where only a basic sketch had been submitted , it meant that many of the notes heard on a recording were not covered by copyright -   and thus could not be infringed upon.
 [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]-POS  ruling had an immediate impact and was widely seen as giving an advantage to defendants in music copyright cases , which often include pop stars and the companies that release their music and typically control their copyrights.
The  [[Sheeran]]-NEG  case is scheduled to go to trial next month.
But last week , lawyers for the singer asked the judge for a delay because , they said ,  [[Sheeran]]-NEG  and other witnesses , who are  [[British]]-NEU  citizens , may not enter  [[United States]]-NEU  under current coronavirus travel restrictions .

Pompeo in  [[Japan]]-POS  to boost solidarity with  [[Asian]]-NEU  allies to counter  [[China]]-NEG
TOKYO (  [[Reuters]]-NEU  ) -  [[United States]]-POS  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEU  on Tuesday began meetings with his  [[Asian]]-POS  and  [[Indo-Pacific]]-NEU  counterparts as [[Washington]] looks to solidify support among the regional allies at a time of historically tension ties with [[China]]
The trip , his first to  [[East Asia]]-NEU  since July 2019 , has been scaled back to one full day in  [[Japan]]-NEU  , after  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was diagnosed with coronavirus , scrapping plans to go to  [[Mongolia]]-NEU  and  [[South Korea]]-POS
Trump has returned to  [[White House]]-NEU  after a three - night hospital stay to be treated for the virus.
 [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS 's trip comes at a time when  [[Washington]]-NEU  and  [[Beijing]]-NEU  , the world's top two economies , are at loggerheads over a wide range of issues from  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's handling of the coronavirus to its imposition of a new security law in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  and ambitions in  [[South China Sea]]-NEU
 [[Washington]]-POS  greatly values the meeting of the  [[Quad]]-POS  grouping of foreign ministers , from  [[United States]]-POS  ,  [[Japan]]-POS  ,  [[Australia]]-POS  and  [[India]]-POS  , as a platform to strengthen its solidarity against  [[China]]-NEG  with regional allies.
" We 're hoping to have some significant announcements , significant achievements , " Pompeo told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in  [[United States]]-NEU  before departing for  [[Tokyo]]-NEU  , but he declined to say what they would be.
 [[China]]-NEU  has denounced the  [[Quad]]-NEG  as an attempt to contain its development.
While the  [[Quad]]-NEG  meeting may not yield a specific action plan , the very fact of its gathering would serve as a warning to  [[China]]-NEG  and play to its fears that it might one day grow into a formalised grouping as  [[NATO]]-NEG  , experts have said.
 [[Indian]]-POS  foreign ministry spokesman  [[Anurag Srivastava]]-POS  said the foreign ministers are likely to emphasise their support for a free and open  [[Indo-Pacific]]-NEU  region at the meeting.
In his first meeting of the day , Pompeo met with  [[Australians]]-NEU  Foreign Minister  [[Marise Payne]]-POS  at the  [[United States]]-NEU  Ambassador's  [[Residence]]-POS  in  [[Tokyo]]-POS
The duo posed in front of their respective flags sporting face masks and with no handshake.
Later on Tuesday ,  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  is expected to meet with  [[Japan]]-NEU 's Prime Minister  [[Yoshihide Suga]]-POS  for the first time since  [[Yoshihide Suga]]-POS  took office.
The  [[Japanese]]-NEG  leader faces a tricky task balancing the need to maintain working ties with  [[Japan]]-NEU 's bigger neighbour  [[China]]-NEU  and  [[United States]]-NEG  demands for a tougher stance.
Most  [[Asian]]-NEU  allies have been pleased with  [[Washington]]-NEG 's toughness toward their regional rival  [[China]]-NEG  , but have not so eagerly welcomed Trump and  [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG 's highly charged recent rhetoric and remain wary of going too far in antagonising  [[China]]-NEG  .

The administration and everything --   you can be in a domestic abusive situation and now we 're in a national abusive situation with a leader who is daily giving us something new to be concerned about , "  [[Robert De Niro]]-POS  said in an interview with  [[Extra]]-POS
The 77-year - old is an outspoken critic of  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG  , having formerly slammed him as the sole reason  [[Americans]]-NEG  are living in an " abusive household.
" The actor said this week that  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG 's reign is the second " virus or pandemic "  [[Americans]]-NEG  are facing right now.
" I ca n't wait , ca n't wait , please God it goes away so we can get back to normal , "  [[Robert De Niro]]-POS  continued.
" Even this virus situation could have been a lot less severe.
I get upset speaking about it right now that this country , this nation has been toyed with , played with , conned to be where we are today.
" When are people gon na to wake up and see what the fraud is right in front of our very eyes ? Most people see it , "  [[Robert De Niro]]-POS  added.
Fegley , who is 15 , praised  [[Robert De Niro]]-POS  as someone " legendary " he looks up to.
Last month ,  [[Robert De Niro]]-NEG  made headlines again when he branded  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG    a " criminal " who will " stop at nothing " to win the   2020 election.
He also paid tribute to the late  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  justice    [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  ,   who died on September 18   at the age of 87 from complications surrounding metastatic pancreatic   cancer .

Trump Insists He Is ' Feeling Great ' as Most of Joint Chiefs Quarantine.
But leaving no room between the vice president and the president on the threat from the virus , Mr  [[Penny]]-POS 's aides said the plan announced on Monday by  [[Commission on Presidential Debates]]-NEU  for him and Ms  [[Harris]]-NEG  to debate while sitting more than a dozen feet apart and behind plexiglass dividers to prevent any viral transmission was unnecessary.
In his tweet on the flu , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  said , " Many people every year , sometimes over 100,000 , and despite the  [[Vaccine]]-NEU  , die from the  [[Influenza]]-NEG  , " and he added that it did not result in shutting the country down.
" No , we have learned to live with it , just like we are learning to live with  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  , in most populations far less lethal ! ! ! " Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  wrote.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's figure for flu deaths was highly misleading.
According to CD.C.
figures , in a typical year over the past decade , fewer than 50,000  [[Americans]]-NEG  died from influenza.
Deaths peaked at an estimated 61,000 in the 2017 - 18 season -   or less than one - third the toll from the coronavirus in an  [[United States]]-NEG  where widespread precautions have been in effect for months.
Without them , many experts say , the coronavirus death toll could have reached into the millions.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  also upended the stimulus talks in  [[Congress]]-NEG  with a series of tweets in which he accused Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  of " not negotiating in good faith " and urged  [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-POS  to focus solely on confirming his nominee to  [[Supreme court]]-POS  , Judge [[Amy Coney Barrett]]
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  said he had instructed his aides to stop negotiating on the stimulus , sending the S&amp;P 500 down 1.4 percent for the day.

From  [[Gettysburg]]-POS  , Biden Calls for Healing of a ' House Divided '
Joseph R Biden Jr delivered an impassioned call for national unity on Tuesday from the swing state of  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , casting the nation as a " house divided " and the election as a high - stakes contest defined by seismic issues of life - or - death consequence that , he argued , should transcend traditional partisan disagreements.
In a 22-minute speech outdoors in  [[Gettysburg]]-POS  , near  [[Civil War]]-NEG  battlefield that serves as a symbol of a country split against itself , Mr Biden drew parallels between that dark time in  [[American]]-NEU  history and the turmoil of the current moment , saying the country was again in " a battle for the soul of the nation , " reprising a central theme of his candidacy four weeks before Election Day.
In his remarks , Mr Biden sought to present himself as a bipartisan figure , eager to paint the most searing issues of the day - the coronavirus , racial injustice , economic crises - as  [[American]]-NEU  challenges , rather than problems that should be viewed through a political lens.
The message was a striking contrast with the recent actions of Mr Biden's opponent , President  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who on Tuesday ended talks with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  about an economic stimulus bill even as millions of  [[Americans]]-NEU  struggle with the financial fallout of the pandemic.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  tested positive for the coronavirus last week and left the hospital on Monday , ripping off his mask at the White House , while Mr Biden , who shared a debate stage with the president a week ago , tested negative again on Tuesday , his campaign said.
Asked later by reporters if he would feel safe debating Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  - there is a debate scheduled for next week - the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee replied , " if he still has  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  , we should n't have a debate , " according to a pool report.
He did not mention his opponent by name , though he delivered an implicit indictment of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's handling of the virus and suggested that the president had stoked an environment where hate thrives - an argument he has made far more directly on many other occasions.
Still , Mr Biden was defiant in expressing belief in reaching out to  [[Republican]]-NEG  even at a moment of staggering political polarization , a view that has drawn skepticism from many in his party.
And he pointed to  [[American]]-NEG  traumas of the past - in particular  [[Civil War]]-NEG  - both as a warning and as evidence that the country is capable of overcoming even the most corrosive divisions.
Later , in a statement released after his address , he denounced Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  - this time by name - for abruptly ending the economic stimulus talks with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , saying that the president had " never even really tried to get a deal " for all of the  [[Americans]]-NEG  who were suffering financially.
Though it is perhaps too soon for the address to amount to a closing argument in the 2020 campaign , his remarks suggested that he intends to end his bid for  [[White House]]-NEU  as he began it : by framing the election as a national emergency whose outcome will determine the trajectory and the character of the country for years to come.
Nodding to the latest chaos fueled by Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  - this time the president's cavalier attitude toward the coronavirus despite being sickened by it himself - Mr Biden built on his longstanding arguments about the need for calm and for the possibility of finding common ground.
" Instead of treating each other's party as the opposition , we treat them as the enemy , " he said.
" This must end.
We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country , the spirit of being able to work with one another.
" And , echoing a message he delivered in  [[Pittsburgh]]-NEU  last month , Mr Biden sought to strike a balance between empathizing with and encouraging protesters of racial injustice , while condemning any episodes of violence , aiming to nullify a baseless  [[Republican]]-NEG  claim that he is radically anti - law enforcement.
" I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in  [[United States]]-NEU  , " he said.
In other ways , the speech - and its focus on bipartisanship - was a culmination of the messages Mr Biden has pressed at key inflection points throughout the presidential campaign , including at  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU  and at his first large - scale rally of the campaign , in  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  last spring.
Mr Biden faces an uphill battle to win over  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Just 15 percent of likely GO.P.
voters in the state have a positive view of him , according to a New York Times / Siena College poll released this week.
But among independent voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , he is viewed more favorably : 54 percent see him positively , while 44 percent see him negatively.
There have also been some signs of Mr Biden's ability to connect with the kinds of  [[Americans]]-NEU  who voted third - party in 2016 because they disliked both presidential candidates at the time.
Nationwide , there was some evidence of Mr Biden building more support in the wake of last week's debate - but not much of it coming from  [[Republican]]-NEU  or  [[Conservatism]]-NEU
A  [[CNN]]-POS  poll conducted after the debate was the first all year to show a majority of  [[Americans]]-NEU  expressing a positive view of Mr Biden.
That was in large part because of a nine - point uptick over the past month in the share of women rating him positively.
Among  [[Republican]]-NEU  , his favorability rating was basically unchanged : Just 12 percent expressed a favorable opinion.
His trip to  [[Gettysburg]]-NEU  came as he sought to press his advantage over Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who trails in polls and remains confined to  [[White House]]-NEU
Mr Biden , who has heeded the advice of experts and been cautious about holding in - person events in recent months , prompting mockery from Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU  , is now the candidate who is out on the campaign trail , albeit still with small , socially distanced events that adhere to public health guidelines.
His  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  trip followed a visit to  [[Florida]]-NEU  on Monday and preceded a planned trip on Thursday to  [[Arizona]]-NEU
Mr Biden is maintaining leads or pulling away from Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  in polls in all three states.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  tweeted on Tuesday that he planned to attend the presidential debate scheduled for October 15 , even as he remains infectious and doctors have warned that the course of his illness is unpredictable.
In a tweet on Monday , he also indicated plans to return to the campaign trail soon.
Mr Biden and Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  shared the debate stage in  [[Cleveland]]-NEU  a week ago , and Mr Biden's campaign said he had tested negative for the coronavirus twice on Friday and again on Sunday , before news of the Tuesday test.

Trump insisting on working from  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  despite isolation rules , infection risks.
Trump insisting on working from  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  despite isolation rules , infection risksA top aide said the president could be back working there later Wednesday.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleEven as President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  remained infected with the novel coronavirus and contagious , his top aide said he is eager to return to work in the Oval Office and could do so as early as Wednesday , disregarding isolation rules and putting staffers at increased risk.
" If he decides to go to the Oval we 've got safety protocols there that are not only from the PPE standpoint but from a ventilation standpoint , in the open where we can actually work to that in as well , " Meadows said , who removed his mask before while taking questions from reporters at a distance Wednesday morning.
The president's push to return to  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  comes as he is supposed to be observing a period of self - isolation , in accordance with  [[CDC]]-NEU  guidelines.
 [[White House]]-NEU  had outfitted the Map Room and Diplomatic Reception Room in the  [[White House]]-NEG  residence as remote working spaces for the president during his period of expected isolation after his made - for - TV return from three nights in the hospital on Monday.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  pulls off his protective face mask as he poses atop  [[Truman Balcony]]-POS  of  [[White House]]-NEU  after returning from being hospitalized at  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]-NEU  for coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) treatment , October 5 , 2020.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  pulls off his protective face mask as he poses atop  [[Truman Balcony]]-NEU  of  [[White House]]-NEU  after returning from being hospitalized at  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]-NEU  for coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) treatment , October 5 , 2020.Meadows , who has been at the president's side on a daily basis throughout his illness , said he continues to test negative for the virus.
While  [[Meadow]]-POS  said staff members surrounding the president have been wearing full PPE , it was unclear whether the president has also been wearing a mask while around others and if he would do so when and if he does return to  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  , while still infected with the virus.
Meadows expressed confidence that necessary safety protocols would be taken to accommodate the president's desired return to  [[West Wing]]-NEU
Some  [[West Wing]]-NEU  staffers who have remained healthy despite the recent outbreak among the ranks of the administration have continued to come into work at the White House in recent days.
The president is so eager to return to his official presidential workspace , Meadows said the president had wanted to do so Tuesday.
After the president's economic adviser  [[Larry Kudlow]]-POS  said the president actually had gone to  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  on Tuesday ,  [[White House]]-NEU  issued a clarification , saying that was not the case.
" While the President wanted to be in  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  yesterday , he was not there - he stayed back in the residence working from there.
Safety preparations have been underway in the event he moves to working out of the  [[Oval]]-NEU  in the coming days , "  [[White House]]-POS  spokesman  [[Ben Williamson]]-POS  said .

' They like me very much ' : Why Trump's  [[QAnon]]-NEG  comments are dangerous.
It included examples of documented behavior in that vein.
Two centered on criminal acts undertaken by people professing to adhere to  [[QAnon]]-NEU
QAnon is difficult to summarize because it is often tailored to the beliefs of the individual adherent.
It centers on the idea that an anonymous actor within the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration , identified as Q , shares updates and information about a secret government effort to uproot an international ring of child abusers and sex traffickers.
It puts President  [[Trump]]-NEG  at the helm of that purported effort , pitting him against an extensive cabal of celebrities and government officials who engage in abuse or seek to protect the abusers.
Only recently , as reports have pegged the number of adherents , casual or otherwise , in the millions , has Trump been directly asked about the movement.
It's a tricky proposition.
Any sign of tacit encouragement from  [[Trump]]-POS  would probably serve only to legitimize  [[QAnon]]-NEG 's belief system.
Asked about it last week , he declined to reject the theory or its adherents , which journalists who track the group saw as likely to encourage their confidence in their theories.
On Wednesday , he went further.
That , of course , is the central concern for  [[Trump]]-POS
With the election looming and his strategy focused on maximizing turnout from his base ,  [[Trump]]-POS 's reelection campaign has quietly given space to the theory's adherents , understanding that they overlap with his supporters.
This was the first time he had been explicit about his motivation , though : They get a pass at least in part because they stand by him.
" I have heard that it is gaining in popularity , " he continued.
" And from what I hear is , these are people that when they watch the streets of  [[Portland]]-NEU  , when they watch what happened in  [[New York City]]-NEG  in just the last six or seven months ... that these are people that do n't like seeing what's going on in places like  [[Portland]]-NEU  and places like  [[Chicago]]-NEU  and  [[New York]]-NEU  and other cities and states.
He again came back to his assertion that  [[QAnon]]-NEU  supporters were focused on street violence in cities with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  mayors.
That is n't true.
So the reporter pressed him on the specifics of what many  [[QAnon]]-NEU  adherents believe.
There was surprised laughter in the room.
Again , this is n't a lark.
The spread of  [[QAnon]]-NEG  is seen by federal law enforcement as a threat to the public.
There are obvious cases in which  [[QAnon]]-NEG  is used by disturbed individuals as a rationale for their actions , as in the murder of a reputed mob boss on  [[Staten Island]]-NEG  last year.
This is the central concern , that fostering a belief that there exists a particularly evil group - its members defined by individual observers - will lead to some of those observers taking steps to confront the presumed evil.
That some  [[QAnon]]-NEG  adherent will decide that some other person is part of the cabal Q is discussing.
That is allegedly what happened on  [[Staten Island]]-NEG
Trump tried multiple times to frame  [[QAnon]]-NEG  as overlapping with his ( itself heavily exaggerated ) war on antifa.
Perhaps this seems like a clever bit of political judo.
If that's the idea , it's a significant misread on both the  [[QAnon]]-NEG  ecosystem and the risk posed by giving it oxygen.
Sure enough , some QAnon groups quickly saw  [[Trump]]-NEG 's comments as validation , an entirely predictable outcome.
The fear is that such an interpretation might then lead to adherents interpreting  [[Trump]]-NEG 's words as authorization to take the fight into their own hands .

Paranoid Harvard lecturer &  [[CNN]]-NEU  analyst mocked for pushing conspiracy theory about  [[Russian]]-NEG  spies at  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's hospital.
A Harvard lecturer , who moonlights as an " analyst " on  [[CNN]]-NEG  , has been busy pushing a crazy conspiracy theory that  [[Russia]]-NEG  has spies in  [[Walter Reed]]-NEG  military hospital , where  [[United States]]-NEG  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  received treatment for Covid-19.
Juliette Kayyem claimed on  [[Twitter]]-POS  that it is " very likely " that  [[Russian]]-NEG  agents infiltrated the hospital and gained access to information about  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's medical condition.
Kayyem , who is a senior lecturer in international security at Harvard's  [[Harvard Kennedy School]]-POS  , provided absolutely no evidence for her wild theory.
But , hey , a lack of evidence has never been an issue for Russophobes in the past.
The message came amid a frenzy of speculation about President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's health and accusations that  [[White House]]-NEG  was not being transparent with the  [[American]]-NEU  public.
" It is very likely that  [[Russian]]-NEU  intelligence agencies - through signal and human intel sources at  [[Walter Reed]]-NEU  , etc - have more information about the President's condition than we do , " the talking head tweeted.
 [[Twitter]]-NEU  users were less than impressed with Kayyem's unsupported speculation and quickly took to mocking the so - called analyst.
Many also took aim at  [[CNN]]-POS  for giving a platform to someone who would make such claims without any supporting evidence.
" Imagine how shocked I was when I saw '  [[CNN]]-NEG  ' in your profile.
I would never in a million years have imagined it , " one popular response read.
" Juliette you should be writing for comedy , " quipped journalist Patrick Henningsen , along with several ' crying with laughter ' emojis .

A Warning From  [[Michigan]]-POS
The goal here is pretty obvious : The conservative legal movement has not been subtle.
In 2017 , then -  [[White House]]-NEU  Counsel  [[Don McGahn]]-POS  said in a speech to  [[Federalist Society]]-NEU  that " the greatest threat to the rule of law in our modern society is the ever - expanding regulatory state , and the most effective bulwark against that threat is a strong judiciary.
" Shortly after , President  [[Trump]]-POS  nominated Gorsuch for a seat on  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-POS
A revived nondelegation doctrine would give conservatives a useful tool to beat back laws adopted under a Biden administration.
Judges have no principled way to identify statutes that delegate too much power or power of the wrong kind , a point made most eloquently by Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEU
But if  [[Michigan]]-POS  is any guide ,  [[Republican]]-POS  judges will be especially eager to find that the line has been crossed once  [[Democrat]]-POS  are in charge.
Torching a democratically enacted law does n't respect democracy.
In  [[Michigan]]-NEG  , doing so shifted power to a legislature under  [[Republican]]-NEG  control thanks to extreme gerrymandering.
In 2018 ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  legislative candidates in  [[Michigan]]-POS  won hundreds of thousands more votes than their  [[Republican]]-NEU  opponents.
Yet  [[Republican]]-POS  have a 58-52 majority in the  [[White House]]-NEU  and a 22-16 majority in the  [[Senate]]-NEU
The nondelegation doctrine is n't about democracy.
It's about the power to restrain government.
And it will be wielded as opportunistically against a President  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as it has been wielded against  [[Whitmer]]-NEG
As a result of last week's decision ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  became the only state in the nation that is not operating under some type of state of emergency.
For now , that does n't mean the end of all COVID-19 protections.
The state's public - health director has the independent power , not at issue in  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  decision , to take emergency actions to control epidemics.
On Monday , the director issued a series of orders incorporating the governor's prior restrictions , including her mask mandate and limits on gatherings.
These orders , too , will surely be challenged.
The larger lesson is that  [[Republican]]-NEU  judges are serious about using their power to obstruct  [[Democrat]]-NEG  in office , even when doing so is legally indefensible and blatantly undemocratic - indeed , even when it jeopardizes human life.
There's no reason to expect a conservative supermajority on  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEG  to act with more restraint.
The  [[Republican]]-POS  - appointed justices have the votes to impede pretty much anything  [[Democrat]]-POS  aim to do , whether that's mitigating climate change , expanding access to health care , or extending statehood to  [[Puerto Rico]]-NEU  or  [[Washington]]-NEU  , DC.
We may all be  [[Michigan]]-NEU  soon.
We want to hear what you think about this article.

Trump Takes Off the Mask.
It is much easier to shrug off a pandemic once you believe you 're safe from harm.
Given how callously Trump already approached the health of his closest aides and donors , his callousness with the nation as a whole comes as little surprise.
In times of crisis ,  [[American]]-NEU  leaders usually want to be like  [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]-POS  , telling the nation in his first inaugural address , " The only thing we have to fear is ... fear itself.
" Or they want to be like  [[George W Bush]]-POS  after 9/11 , telling  [[Americans]]-POS  to go about their lives in the face of terrorism.
They imagine the nation carrying on with the stiff upper lip of  [[Londoner]]-NEU  amid the Blitz or V-2 attacks.
This is the rhetorical tradition from which  [[Trump]]-POS  is drawing when he calls on  [[Americans]]-NEG  not to " let the coronavirus dominate you " and to " learn to live with it.
" But  [[Trump]]-NEG 's exhortations are built on a simple but crucial error.
 [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]-NEG  was speaking to a nation petrified by a sudden economic collapse-"nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.
"  [[George W Bush]]-POS 's point was that the goal of terrorism was to freeze people into staying home , thus ruining social bonds and the economy ; only by resisting fear could  [[Americans]]-NEG  resist terror.
But a virus ca n't be bluffed.
Its effects are physiological , not psychological.
It is different from an aerial bombardment - Britons could not control how many bombs fell on them , but acting recklessly with the virus promises to increase the number of people who will be infected , and the number who will die.
Trump has certainly tried to bluff COVID-19.
He pretended that the virus would not make it to  [[American]]-NEU  shores.
He spent more time engaging in petty disputes over federalism with governors than preparing the country.
He encouraged businesses to reopen and states to drop their restrictions.
He demanded that schools reopen , but failed to provide the resources needed to get the pandemic under sufficient control for parents , teachers , and staff to feel safe sending kids back.
He sought to defy the virus in his personal life too.
He refused to wear a mask regularly , practice social distancing , and cancel risky events such as in - person fundraisers and rallies.
Last week , the coronavirus called his bluff.
The president had to be given supplemental oxygen , helicoptered to a hospital , and given experimental drugs - the best care in the world , at no cost to himself , billed to those  [[Americans]]-NEU  who actually pay their income taxes.
He decided to leave the hospital yesterday against the recommendations of many medical experts.
Now Trump is encouraging all other  [[Americans]]-NEU  to take the same risks he did , apparently to boost his electoral prospects.
It is true that most people who contract the virus will not die.
But some will - about 210,000  [[Americans]]-NEU  already have.
Even if they live , the long - term effects of the illness are still not well understood.
 [[Americans]]-NEG  who catch the disease might have to foot large medical bills.
They will miss work , and may lose their job , at a time when unemployment is high.
If  [[Americans]]-POS  take  [[Trump]]-POS 's advice , some of them will die , and many of them will suffer in lesser ways .

An exchange about  [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor]]-NEU  and  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  crystallizes the candidates ' opposing views on racial justice.
An exchange between Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  late in the debate crystallized the deep differences in the two sides ' approaches to racial justice.
She then linked the killing of Ms  [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor]]-NEU  to the killing of other Black people by the police , like  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  in  [[Minneapolis]]-NEU  , and said that if elected , she and Joseph R Biden Jr would ban chokeholds , create a national registry for police officers who act illegally , close private prisons and decriminalize marijuana , among other changes to the criminal justice system.
Mr  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  , by contrast , claimed that it was a " great insult " to police officers to say that there was implicit racial bias in law enforcement at all.
Research consistently shows that officers disproportionately stop Black people , arrest Black people , and use force - often fatal - against Black people.
Mr  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  also suggested that it was disturbing for a former prosecutor like Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  to " assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence got it wrong , " even though a member of the grand jury came forward publicly last month to express concerns about the proceedings , saying the jury had not been given the option to indict the other officers.
And he said that Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  had " repeatedly " condemned white supremacists , though the president declined to do so just last week , during his first debate with Mr Biden .

A Trump - supporting plexiglass manufacturer on plexiglass getting political.
 [[Jaime Harrison]]-POS  , the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  challenging  [[Lindsey Graham]]-NEG  , brought his own plexiglass to the  [[South Carolina]]-NEU   [[Senate]] debate over the weekend.
In Wednesday night's vice - presidential debate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  and Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  will be separated by two sheets of it.
For months , the plexiglass business has been booming for  [[James Meadows]]-POS  , who manufactures it from his refrigeration parts shop in southeast  [[Texas]]-POS
A staunch supporter of President  [[Trump]]-POS  , Mr  [[James Meadows]]-POS  believes that by selling it he is " pandering to the uninformed , " though he's happy to have the business.
Orders peaked in the summer and continue to trickle in , as the number of Covid-19 cases has climbed past 810,000 in the state.
Just a week or so ago , he fulfilled an order for 100 sheets for the local school district to install.
So far , the president's illness has done little to change the partisan view of the pandemic , including Mr  [[James Meadows]]-NEG 's.
He dismisses it as overblown , though more than 16,000 people have died in  [[Jefferson County]]-NEG  , where he has lived for decades.
Even as Mr  [[James Meadows]]-NEG  fulfills orders , he doubts the barriers do anything other than give some people a bit of peace of mind.
Though several scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of face masks in stopping the spread of coronavirus , there have not been similar findings on plexiglass.
The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  first spoke to Mr  [[James Meadows]]-POS  this spring , when the pandemic was most heavily felt in urban  [[United States]]-NEU  , where residents predominantly support  [[Democrat]]-POS
That gap has narrowed considerably , and public polling shows widespread support for mask requirements .

Trump plots return to campaign trail as soon as Monday despite COVID-19 diagnosis.
Just days removed from  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]-NEU  , and still battling the coronavirus , President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's reelection campaign is already plotting the president's return to the campaign trail , with an event in the cards for as soon as early next week.
The president has been sidelined for nearly a week after testing positive for the coronavirus late last Thursday , forcing the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign to cancel five previously announced rallies in  [[Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  , and  [[Arizona]]-NEU
In recent days ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's team has started working to nail down details for a potential return to the campaign trail for the first time since the president tested positive , with a return event under consideration for as soon as Monday and possibly in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , multiple sources tell  [[ABC News]]-POS
The president's team is also eyeing a return to other campaign stops in swing states including  [[Iowa]]-NEU  , where campaign staff toured potential event sites earlier this week , sources tell  [[ABC News]]-NEU
Trump's quick return to the campaign trail is dependent on how the president feels in the coming days , sources said.
Since being forced off the trail last week , the president has been itching to return , urging advisers that he wants to restart his signature rallies as soon as possible.
The president has also repeatedly made it known that he plans to get back on the road sooner rather than later.
" Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon ! ! !  [[Fake news]]-NEU  only shows the Fake Polls , " the president tweeted shortly after returning to  [[White House]]-NEU  from  [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]-NEU
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  arrives for a campaign rally at Pittsburgh International Airport in  [[Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Penn]]-NEU  , September 22 , 2020.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  arrives for a campaign rally at Pittsburgh International Airport in  [[Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Penn]]-NEU  , September 22 , 2020.The president was scheduled to hold a previously unannounced rally in the Hawkeye State on Thursday of this week , before plans were scrapped following  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's diagnosis , sources said.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
The timing of the president's return to in - person rallies has not been decided and  [[White House]]-NEG  has yet to sign off on any upcoming travel while Trump recovers from COVID-19 , a source said.
Details around the type and size of possible venues were not immediately known.
The president held 15 rallies in September after a brief pause following a dismal turnout at a much - hyped  [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]-NEU  ,  [[Oklahoma]]-NEG  , rally in June.
Most of the recent rallies have been outdoors at airplane hangers , in addition to one indoor rally in  [[Henderson]]-NEU  ,  [[Nevada]]-POS
But while the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign says they provide hand sanitizer , check temperatures , and pass out masks at events , most supporters do n't wear masks and the crowds are typically packed shoulder - to - shoulder with no social distancing enforced.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign says that despite the president contracting the coronavirus , no extra health precautions are set to be implemented at future events.
Since the first presidential debate and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's coronavirus diagnosis , the president has seen a drop in national polls , with  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  now leading by 9.3 points -- the former vice president's largest lead since late August -- according to FiveThirtyEight's average.

The number of COVID-19 cases related to  [[White House]]-NEG  has ballooned to 34 , according to an internal government memo , including  [[White House]]-NEU  adviser  [[Stephen Miller]]-NEU
The recent surge in positive cases around the president has also impacted the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign directly , with campaign manager  [[Bill Stepien]]-NEG  testing positive last week .

' I 'm a perfect physical specimen ' :  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  says he beat Covid-19 because he's ' extremely young , ' critics go crazy.
 [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has defined himself as a " perfect physical specimen " and said he overcame his bout of Covid-19 thanks to being " extremely young " and healthy , sending his critics into a frenzy.
During a Thursday morning  [[Fox Business]]-POS  interview , host  [[Maria Bartiromo]]-POS  told Trump it was " amazing " that he had come back to  [[White House]]-NEU  from his brief quarantine at the  [[Walter Reed]]-NEU  medical center " in such strong form.
" The compliment prompted Trump into some unreserved self - praise.
While the president's comment that he is " extremely young " was clearly sarcasm ,  [[Netizen]]-NEU  were not so sure about the " perfect physical specimen " part - and he was quickly ridiculed by critics , who began to post unflattering comparison images on  [[Twitter]]-NEU
Others commenters , however , like the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  reporter  [[Alan Rappeport]]-NEG  , took  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's grandiose self - description as a simple joke.
 [[White House]]-NEU  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  even weighed in on the comments during a press conference later on Thursday , apparently taking them very seriously.
" His disassociation from reality would be funny if it were n't so deadly , " she said.
While clearly not lacking in confidence about his physical appearance and health ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  did admit in the interview that he could afford to lose some weight.
" Perhaps a couple of pounds we could lose here and there , but you know , I 'm in good health , " he told  [[Maria Bartiromo]]-POS
Trump had previously made similarly positive comments about his Covid-19 recovery , tweeting on Monday that he " felt better than he did 20 years ago , " while returning to  [[White House]]-NEU  after being treated at  [[Walter Reed]]-NEU  .

 [[Donald Trump]]-POS  says remaining  [[United States]]-NEU  troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  should be home ' by Christmas '
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has hinted that all  [[United States]]-NEU  soldiers in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  could be home by Christmas , seemingly going against his own national security adviser , who said more than 2,000 troops would remain beyond the new year.
" We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in  [[Afghanistan]]-POS  home by Christmas ! "    [[Donald Trump]]-POS  tweeted on Wednesday evening , exactly 19 years to the day after the  [[United States]]-NEG  invasion of the country in 2001.
Though the missive did not indicate any shift in policy , the suggestion of a full withdrawal by the holiday is at odds with the timetable laid out by  [[National security]]-POS  Advisor  [[Robert O'Brien]]-NEG  just hours earlier on Wednesday , when he told an audience at  [[University of Nevada, Reno]]-NEU  ,  [[Las Vegas]]-NEU  that the administration would retain some 2,500 soldiers in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  in early 2021.
Under a deal signed with the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  earlier this year , the  [[United States]]-NEG  agreed to a complete pull - out of combat troops by spring 2021 , withdrawing forces in stages as the  [[Afghan]]-NEU  government works toward a long - term ceasefire with the militant group.
As of Wednesday , between 4,000 and 5,000  [[United States]]-NEG  troops remain in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  , according to  [[Robert O'Brien]]-POS  , the lowest troop level since the initial phase of the war nearly two decades ago.
Despite vowing to bring a swift end to the war upon taking office in 2008 , former president  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  failed to implement any full withdrawal , instead launching a massive ' surge ' that saw the  [[United States]]-NEU  troop presence swell to over 100,000 , the largest number to date.
Though Obama scaled back deployments following the surge , he left more than 8,000 troops in the country at the end of his second term in 2016 , dragging on the longest conflict in  [[American]]-NEU  history into a third presidency over what he deemed a " precarious " security situation.
While  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  has long called for  [[United States]]-NEU  forces to be brought home from  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  , and by all indications intends to fulfill the spring 2021 deadline for a complete withdrawal set under the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  deal , he has previously suggested that  [[American]]-NEU  intelligence personnel would remain in the country even after combat troops leave , hinting at prolonged  [[United States]]-NEG  involvement .

This week's Quad ministerial meeting , in four charts.
As I previewed earlier this week , the  [[Australians]]-NEU  and  [[Japanese]]-NEU  foreign ministers , the  [[Indian]]-NEU  external affairs minister , and the  [[United States]]-NEU  secretary of state met in  [[Tokyo]]-POS  on October 6 for the second ministerial of the Quadrilateral , or "  [[Quad]]-POS
" My previous post included charts explaining the evolution and the activities of the  [[Quad]]-NEU  ahead of the ministerial.
Now that the meeting has taken place , let's take a look at the outcomes , including what emerged from it and what did n't.
While the  [[Quad]]-NEU  ministers did not release a joint statement ,  [[Australia]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEU  ,  [[Japan]]-NEU  , and the  [[United States]]-NEU  did issue readouts.
They provide a sense of the agenda , as well as where there is - and is not - overlap.
The separate readouts also give some additional details.
For instance , the  [[Japanese]]-POS  one noted that  [[North Korea]]-POS  and  [[South China Sea]]-POS  came up for discussion ; the  [[Australians]]-POS  and  [[Indian]]-POS  ones mentioned the delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines ; and  [[Canberra]]-POS 's document highlighted the subject of critical minerals.
In their readouts as well as their opening statements , each  [[Quad]]-NEU  country also outlined its vision of the kind of  [[Indo-Pacific]]-POS  it would like to see.
All four also emphasized the importance of working with other like - minded partners ( even beyond  [[ASEAN]]-NEU  , or  [[ASEAN]]-NEU  )
 [[Japan]]-POS  mentioned  [[European]]-NEU  partners , in particular.
As expected , no announcement was made about including  [[Australia]]-NEU  in the US.-India - Japan MALABAR maritime exercise , but  [[Indian]]-NEU  official sources indicated that an announcement would be made before the exercise in November.
While most of the countries did not explicitly mention  [[China]]-NEG  , there were various implicit references to it.
Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  was the exception , mentioning [[Chinese Communist Party]] in particular.
The lack of consensus on whether or not - and how - to mention  [[China]]-NEU  might be one reason why the countries did not release a joint statement.
Nonetheless , in a subsequent press availability ,  [[American]]-NEU  officials made clear that  [[China]]-POS  was discussed.
They also indicated that  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's behavior vis - à - vis  [[Australia]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEU  , and  [[Japan]]-NEU  over the last few months - rather than the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration's urging - increased their enthusiasm for the  [[Quad]]-POS
The 2020 ministerial was the first standalone meeting of the  [[Quad]]-NEU  - previous minister - level and working - level meetings have taken place on the sidelines of other summits.
The readouts of the four countries noted the importance of regularizing the ministerial , as well as continuing working - level and subject experts ' meetings.
The visit to  [[Tokyo]]-POS  also provided an opportunity for Minister  [[Marise Payne]]-POS  , Minister  [[Subrahmanyam Jaishankar]]-POS  , and Secretary  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  to meet with new  [[Japanese]]-POS  Prime Minister  [[Yoshihide Suga]]-POS  , as well as for the four countries to have bilateral meetings with each other .

Once again ,  [[Trump]]-NEG 's rhetoric overlaps with arguments used to rationalize violence.
Theoretically , those guidelines suggested slow reopenings beginning in May.
But Trump insisted that some states could reopen sooner and began actively calling out states run by  [[Democrat]]-NEG  for not immediately scaling back their restrictions.
The state of  [[Michigan]]-NEG  was already an epicenter of opposition to pandemic - related restrictions.
When a caravan of protesters traveled to the state's capital on April 15 to protest orders by Gov.
 [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  ( D ) ,  [[Trump]]-POS  obviously understood the overlap between their politics and his own - despite their protesting a policy that he ostensibly advocated.
In short order , he endorsed the challenge to  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-POS  explicitly.
That " liberate " verbiage was criticized at the time as dangerous in its implications.
At a briefing on April 18 , a reporter raised that point with  [[Trump]]-POS
" I think I feel very comfortable , " he concluded , after briefly disparaging  [[Virginia]]-NEU 's  [[Democrat]]-NEU  governor.
 [[Virginia]]-POS  was also mentioned in one of  [[Trump]]-POS 's " liberate " tweets - with the added context that , in his view , the state's leadership was hoping to end gun rights.
This is an obviously problematic mixture , blending calls for " liberation " with criticisms of " tyranny " and the need to defend gun ownership.
That came to a head when armed protesters stormed the state capitol building in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , calling for an end to shutdowns.
On Thursday , the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-POS  announced it had charged six men who it said were part of an alleged plot to kidnap  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG
The criminal complaint detailing the government's evidence depicts a serious effort to obtain weapons and explosives , to train for their use , to surveil  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG 's vacation home in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and even to disable a bridge with the goal of preventing law enforcement from assisting  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  during an attack.
It does n't seem that the rhetoric motivating the alleged threat against  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  derived from  [[Trump]]-NEG
The group first came to law enforcement's attention in March when allegedly targeting police ; it apparently was n't until June that the focus on  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-POS  emerged.
Instead , it seems clear that  [[Trump]]-POS  understands the political utility of using similar language , of portraying himself as standing with those who see the government as a threat , however improbable that might be , given his own position.
He knows that armed individuals who are skeptical of the government and who oppose coronavirus restrictions are people who are likely to vote for him , so he echoes and amplifies them.
In an April  [[YouGov]]-POS  poll , 6 in 10  [[Michigander]]-NEU  rejected the idea that a lockdown was unconstitutional.
More than half of  [[Republican]]-NEU  , though , said it was.
Nationally ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  were more likely than  [[Democrat]]-NEU  or independents to say lockdowns were unconstitutional , but were more evenly split on the subject.
Trump gives those dangerous groups oxygen.
The  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-POS  announced last year that  [[QAnon]]-NEG  was one of a number of fringe groups whose adherents might commit acts of violence.
This month ,  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  released a report identifying violent white supremacists as a primary threat to the country.
Calling for the " liberation " of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  states and approving of armed protests targeting his opponents might be politically useful for  [[Trump]]-POS  , but the risks should be obvious.
We 've seen several examples in which violent acts have been committed by people echoing  [[Trump]]-NEG 's rhetoric , if not directly.
Before a mass shooting in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  last year , the alleged shooter is thought to have published a document mirroring  [[Trump]]-NEG 's language about immigrants.
More recently , a 17-year - old is accused of killing two people in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEG  ,  [[Wis]]-NEG  , at a protest following a police shooting in the city.
Trump had repeatedly argued that violence at protests centered on racial justice posed a threat to the country.
 [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  allegedly took his rifle and traveled across state lines to serve as a citizen peacekeeper , with tragic results.
Trump later defended the teen's actions.
The alleged plot to target  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  was also cognizant of the political calendar.
Luckily , federal law enforcement was able to track and disrupt this alleged plot.
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's disinterest in rejecting extremists and his explicit mirroring of their rhetoric , though , does n't diminish the likelihood that other such plots exist.
Update : On Thursday evening ,  [[Trump]]-POS  addressed the alleged plot in a series of tweets.
They began by attacking  [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  and never criticized the alleged plotters .

The Kamala Harris Pick : Geographic Balance Takes Back Seat to Gender , Race.
"  [[Geography]]-POS  died a long time ago as a decisive factor , "  [[Anita Dunn]]-POS  , a top  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  adviser , said of running mates in presidential elections.
In 2000 ,  [[Al Gore]]-NEG  lost his home state of  [[Tennessee]]-NEU  at the top of the ticket.
In 2004 ,  [[John Kerry]]-POS  picked a  [[Southern]]-NEG  running mate ,  [[John Edwards]]-NEG  , who lost his home state of  [[North Carolina]]-NEU
And in 2012 ,  [[Paul Ryan]]-NEG  did not help  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG
" Geographic balance seems to be a thing of the political past with our 24/7 media cycle , " said  [[Scott Reed]]-POS  , who was the campaign manager for  [[Bob Dole]]-NEU  1996 bid for president.
Mr  [[Bob Dole]]-POS  chose  [[Jack Kemp]]-POS  of  [[New York]]-POS  as his running mate ; they lost  [[New York]]-NEG  to  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG
Gender and race are another matter , especially in today's political environment as  [[Democrat]]-NEU  seek to prevent Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  from winning a second term.
Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  had said late in the primary season that he would select a woman as his running mate , and he had been lobbied aggressively for months to select a Black woman.
Many  [[Democrat]]-NEU  celebrated the history - making choice on Tuesday.
Not only has no Black woman ever been nominated for vice president or president ; a Black woman has never served as governor of any state .

Privatizing Airports Is a No - Brainer.
" If any  [[United States]]-NEU  city wanted to do a deal for its airport , there 'd be a line of investors down the block tomorrow , " says DJ Gribbin , an infrastructure consultant who was the architect of the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration's 2018 plan to repair  [[United States]]-NEU 's aging roads , bridges , tunnels , and , also , airports.
" There are literally hundreds of billions of dollars sloshing around investment markets wanting to invest in  [[United States]]-POS  infrastructure today , " Gribbin added.
Airports operate almost as two different businesses.
On the aviation side , airports are like a nonprofit that's supported by the airlines.
By law , whatever it costs an airport to keep planes and passengers moving in and out all year long must be offset , exactly , by fees paid by the airlines.
If an airport spends $ 100 million on aviation , the airlines pay the airport $ 100 million.
The non - aviation side of the business - the part that's like a shopping mall with airplanes parked outside - can make a profit from rent paid by shoe shiners and coffee shops , or from parking fees and the like.
Back in the good flying times of 2017 , for instance ,  [[Dallas]]-POS  / Fort Worth International Airport ( DFW ) brought in $ 841 million in revenue from various rents and fees and reported $ 69 million in operating income ( that's profit , basically )
But the cities of  [[Dallas]]-NEU  and  [[Fort Worth, Texas]]-NEG  , which spent at least $ 8 billion in today's money to turn a massive patch of prairie scrub into one of the world's biggest airports , did n't get one nickel of that.
No city owner would have.
 [[Federal Aviation Administration]]-NEG  (  [[Federal Aviation Administration]]-NEG  ) does not allow local governments to use any money from non - aviation profits for anything other than reinvestment in the airports themselves.
A city ca n't build a baseball diamond with the profits of its airport.
It can just build more airport.
If privatization seems extreme or perhaps unsafe , consider that , under  [[Federal Aviation Administration]]-NEU  rules ,  [[United States]]-NEU  cities , counties , and other public entities ca n't actually sell off the runways , terminals , and land that make up their " commercial service airports , " the kind that most of us use to catch a flight.
What they can sell are long - term leases to let private companies operate everything at an airport.
And the outside operators would still be beholden to the  [[Federal Aviation Administration]]-NEU  and  [[Transportation Security Administration]]-NEU  and various regulations applied to every  [[United States]]-NEU  airport.
You wo n't be able to smoke on a flight out of  [[Las Vegas]]-NEU  just because McCarran International goes private.
So why do n't governments jump at the chance ? Local governments do get tax revenue from airports , which they can use for whatever purpose they wish.
That's often not a huge sum , though.
In 2017 , when  [[DFW]]-POS  reported $ 841 million in revenue , the city of  [[Dallas]]-POS  - which owns 64 percent of DFW to  [[Fort Worth, Texas]]-NEG  36 percent - got just $ 7.1 million from taxes generated at the airport.
That money would barely have covered the city's $ 6.9 million outlay for municipal - court administrative services that same year.
Incidentally , privatization agreements can easily be structured to deliver municipalities money post - sale , in the form of revenue or profit sharing with private operators.
A privatized DFW sharing just 2 percent of revenue in 2017 would have netted the city of  [[Dallas]]-NEU  both its $ 7.1 million in taxes and $ 10.7 million in revenue sharing .

Both parties prepare for possibility of contested election as chaotic  [[White House]]-NEG  race hurtles to a close.
She has also directed some of her members to be ready if  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  legislatures in states with narrow margins or unfinished counts seek to appoint their own electors , a situation  [[Democrat]]-POS  hope to head off with an obscure law from the 19th century that allows  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  to intervene.
The internal talks are among a number of strategy sessions taking place in political and legal circles in anticipation of a post - Election Day fight.
The campaigns of President  [[Trump]]-POS  and former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  are preparing for all scenarios , each amassing robust legal teams to prepare for post - Nov.
3 disputes , in addition to monitoring Election Day activity and ballot counting.
An uncharted battle over who the next president will be , after a campaign that has roiled and exhausted  [[Americans]]-NEU  , could severely test the nation's faith in its election system - and undermine the principle that the president should be selected by voters rather than  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  or the courts , experts said.
Campaign operatives , election lawyers and constitutional scholars say there are several scenarios that could push the outcome of the  [[White House]]-NEU  race to  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  for the fourth time in history - or to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , as happened in the contested 2000 election.
While most agree such possibilities are slim ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  has heightened concerns - and preparations - by repeatedly refusing to commit to conceding if he loses , while declaring that he wants the courts to play a role in deciding the race.
Many legal and voting rights experts who have been studying the arcane rules that would govern a contested election say they are less worried about  [[Trump]]-NEG  refusing to concede if he loses decisively than they are about a complicated delay over disputed ballots.
" I wonder what that's going to leave us with , if we do n't have any shared - upon norms , when there's not a basic understanding that winning at all costs is not good for us , "  [[Pérez]]-POS  said during a virtual panel discussion last week.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's continued strength in national and battleground - state polls has heartened  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , who are hopeful that he will win by such a large margin that it will be pointless for  [[Trump]]-NEU  to challenge the results.
" If  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  is going to have the kind of blowout victory we 're looking at , there are not really any constitutional ploys that could save  [[Trump]]-NEG 's presidency , " said Rep.
Jamie B Raskin ( D - Md.
) , who has been working alongside  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  Chairman  [[Hakeem Jeffries]]-POS  ( D - NY.
) to look at all the possibilities.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign declined to comment.
For its part , the  [[Trump]]-POS  campaign said that its goal is for every " valid " ballot to count - and that  [[Democrat]]-POS  are trying to " shred " election integrity.
 [[White House]]-POS    [[Democrat]]-POS  are planning in conjunction with the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign , while the  [[Trump]]-POS  campaign and [[Republican National Committee]] are leading efforts to monitor results , challenge ballots and litigate as necessary.
A spokesman for  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  , Michael McAdams , declined to describe  [[White House]]-NEG   [[Republican]] ' plans.
" We do n't publicly engage or comment on hypotheticals , " he said.
Strategists and scholars agree that the results of the  [[White House]]-NEG  race might not be available on election night if at least one pivotal battleground state has not finished counting mail ballots by then.
Election officials across the country are experiencing a surge of mail ballots from voters seeking to avoid coronavirus infection at the polls.
Two key battlegrounds ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , do not permit local election officials to begin processing mail ballots until Election Day.
During  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's June primary , some counties were still counting ballots more than two weeks after voting had ended.
And roughly two dozen states plan to allow ballots to arrive days after November   3 , including the key battlegrounds  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Ohio]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  and  [[Iowa]]-NEU
In  [[Michigan]]-POS  , the deadline is November   17.
Depending on the overall electoral count , a close race in any of these states on Election Day could leave the overall outcome uncertain until most ballots are received.
Even in states where counting is completed on November   3 , a very close margin is likely to prompt the campaigns to scrutinize ballots for opportunities to challenge their eligibility , over issues such as signature matching , witness signatures or the use of an outer security envelope where one is required.
Both sides are prepared to take such challenges to court , a scenario that could again put  [[Supreme court]]-POS  in the position of effectively deciding the outcome of the election , as it did in the 2000 contest between  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  and  [[Al Gore]]-NEU
 [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-POS 's role , meanwhile , will hinge on whether any difference - making disputes remain unresolved by December   14 , when all states ' electors are required to cast their votes.
In the first scenario in which  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  could decide the election , neither candidate is able to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to claim victory , triggering a provision in the  [[Constitution]]-NEU  12th Amendment sending the decision to  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU
Under that exceedingly rare scenario , which has happened only twice in  [[United States]]-NEU  history , the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  would choose the president , and the  [[Senate]]-NEU  would select the vice president.
Federal law sets such a " contingent " election for January   6 , after the new  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  is seated.
A 269-to-269 tie in the electoral college is among the circumstances that would prompt such a contingency - though scholars and election modelers say that even in a close election , the odds of such an outcome are extremely low.
A narrow electoral - college vote of 270 to 268 could also be thrown into a tie by a " faithless elector " - an elector who votes for someone other than their party's nominee.
No presidential outcome has ever been determined by a faithless elector.
Alternately , a winning candidate could die after November   3 , freeing his electors to vote for someone else and potentially dividing them among multiple choices.
Courts have ruled that electors can be forced to take pledges to support their party's nominee , and earlier this year  [[Supreme court]]-POS  said electors can be legally bound by that pledge.
However , not all states have adopted the kind of binding law that the high court approved , leaving the electoral college as a whole still vulnerable to the whims of a faithless elector.
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's battle with the coronavirus over the past week has prompted discussions about such a scenario , several scholars said.
In the case of any of those scenarios forcing a contingent election , each state delegation in the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-POS  would receive a single vote , meaning a candidate would need 26 votes out of 50 to win the presidency.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  currently control 26 delegations , and  [[Democrat]]-POS  control 22.
That is one of the reasons  [[Pelosi]]-POS  has been so focused in recent weeks on trying to flip  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  - led delegations or take control of tied ones , so the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-POS  would have the votes to elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  if necessary.
During a phone call last week with  [[Democrat]]-POS  , she identified her targets as  [[Alaska]]-NEU  ,  [[Montana]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Michigan]]-NEU  - states where she is directing campaign funds and seeking donors to do the same , according to people familiar with the call.
Flipping a single delegation would block  [[Trump]]-NEG  from having the 26 delegations needed for the win in the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU
The  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  has chosen the president this way only twice - in 1801 and 1825.
A more likely scenario , scholars say , is the popular vote remaining in dispute , or uncounted , in one or more states by December   14 , the date when all electors in the electoral college are required to meet and vote.
Federal law empowers state legislatures to step in and appoint electors if an election has " failed " to produce a result.
But what constitutes a " failed " election is the subject of much dispute - one of dozens of reasons so many of these scenarios would be likely to wind up in court.
Consider what could happen if the race comes down to  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , where  [[Republican]]-NEU  control the legislature and Gov.
 [[Tom Wolf]]-POS  is a  [[Democrat]]-POS
If  [[Trump]]-POS  is ahead in the state as December   14 approaches but outstanding ballots are expected to favor  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , " that would create an opportunity for the state legislature to say : ' We have to act.
We ca n't wait for this , so we 're going to certify Trump based on the returns we have in our hands , '   "  [[Douglas]]-POS  said.
In turn , if additional ballots were then counted , putting  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ahead , the executive branch might subsequently certify  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as the winner and seat his electors.
If that happened , two rival sets of electors could meet and vote on December   14 - because not doing so would mean missing the deadline and effectively forfeiting the election , several scholars said.
At that point , an obscure 19th - century law called  [[Electoral Count Act]]-NEU  lays out the role for  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU
The act , which was passed after states submitted competing slates of electors in the contested presidential election of 1876 , gives  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-POS  the power to settle state - level disputes with a vote in both chambers to decide which candidates ' electors will be recognized.
The law is widely regarded by scholars as confusing.
If it is invoked , litigation is almost guaranteed , said  [[Edward B Foley]]-POS  , a professor of constitutional law at  [[Ohio State University]]-POS
But  [[Edward B Foley]]-POS  said he was doubtful that  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  would take such a consequential case involving  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEG 's constitutional powers.
 [[Electoral Count Act]]-NEU  would come into play if states with divided governments - in which one party controls the legislature and the other controls the governorship - submit rival sets of electors.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  is one of four key battlegrounds , along with  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , that have  [[Republican]]-POS  - led legislatures and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  governors.
All have recent histories of exceedingly close elections.
 [[Electoral Count Act]]-NEG  has never been tested in a rival - electors scenario.
The 2000 battle over  [[Florida]]-NEU  between  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  and  [[Al Gore]]-NEU  came close , but  [[Supreme court]]-POS  ended a recount in that state on December   12 , allowing election officials to certify the results for  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  and seat his electors , who cast their electoral votes ahead of the deadline.
Unlike a contingent election , resolving a dispute over seated electors for the presidency falls to the entire  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  , not just the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU
If  [[Republican]]-NEG  retain control of the  [[Senate]]-NEU  in the new  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEG  do the same in the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  , then the two chambers could deadlock over such disputes.
In that case , scholars said , the electors seated by a state's executive branch - its governor or secretary of  [[State]]-NEU  - would prevail over those seated by the state legislature ( though that scenario , too , would be likely to prompt litigation )
If the decision does go to  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  , many smaller variables could play a role , and lawyers for the campaigns are studying all of them.
If Senator  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-POS  ( R - Ga.
) fails to win a majority in her special election on November   3 , for instance , a runoff election could preclude her being seated in January - giving  [[Democrat]]-POS  an edge in that chamber , depending on how many other seats they win or lose.
Another possibility : Neither candidate reaches 270 electoral votes , the decision goes to the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  , and the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEG 's state delegations deadlock at 25 to 25.
If the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEG  is unable to choose the next president , under  [[Twelfth Amendment]]-POS  , the  [[Senate]]-POS 's choice for vice president becomes the acting president until the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEG  can resolve its differences.
If the  [[Senate]]-NEG  deadlocks , too , and no president is selected by Inauguration Day , January   20 , the speaker of the  [[House Democratic Caucus]]-NEU  , upon resigning the speakership and the seat in  [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]-NEU  , becomes acting president until the dispute is settled.
 [[Edward B Foley]]-POS  noted with some optimism that none of the post - election crisis scenarios he has been studying for much of his career is likely to happen .

A federal judge expands  [[Ohio]]-NEU  ballot drop boxes , handing a victory to voting rights groups.
A federal judge has approved a plan pushed by voting rights groups to expand the number of ballot drop boxes in  [[Ohio]]-NEU  , ruling that state officials failed to prove claims that extra drop boxes would lead to voter fraud.
The ruling Thursday night , by Judge Dan Aaron Polster of  [[United States district court]]-NEU  in  [[Cleveland]]-NEU  , cleared the way for officials in  [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]]-NEU  - the state's second - largest jurisdiction , home to  [[Cleveland]]-NEU  and a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  stronghold - to place ballot drop boxes at six library branches.
While the ruling focused on one county , it could lead to additional drop boxes being placed in other locations around the state.
 [[Kristen Clarke]]-POS  , chief executive of  [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law]]-POS  , one of the voting rights groups that filed the lawsuit , called the added drop boxes " crucial " in allowing safe voting during the pandemic.
Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Frank LaRose]]-NEU  ,  [[Ohio]]-NEU 's top elections official , said he would appeal the decision to [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]
" The place to make changes in how we run our elections is the statehouse , not the courthouse , " Mr  [[Frank LaRose]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-NEU  , said in a statement Friday morning.
Mr  [[Frank LaRose]]-POS  had limited ballot drop boxes to one per county and required that they be situated outside county elections offices.
Mr  [[Frank LaRose]]-POS  had approved one extra drop box in  [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]]-POS  at the request of local elections officials.
Lawyers for both the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign and  [[Ohio Republican Party]]-NEU  had joined the case on Mr  [[Frank LaRose]]-POS 's side .

 [[Ohio]]-NEU  county says nearly 50,000 voters received wrong ballots.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleCOLUMBUS ,  [[Ohio]]-POS  -- Nearly 50,000 voters received incorrect absentee ballots in the county that is home to  [[Ohio]]-NEU 's capital and largest city , elections officials said Friday as they promised corrected ballots would be mailed within 72 hours.
With about 240,000 ballots mailed , that meant one in five voters received a wrong ballot.
The error happened Saturday afternoon when someone changed a setting on a machine that places absentee ballots into mailing envelopes ,  [[Franklin County]]-NEU  elections officials said Thursday.
Some ballots had an incorrect congressional race , while others had the correct information but were sent to voters in a different precinct.
The Franklin County Elections Board said 49,669 voters received incorrect ballots out of 237,498 that were mailed.
That represents 6 % of  [[Franklin County]]-NEU  approximately 880,000 registered voters , and 0.6 % of the 8 million voters registered statewide in the presidential battleground.
The process to print , stuff the replacement ballots in envelopes and mail them was underway Friday , the Franklin County Elections Board announced.
The board also said it will mail postcards to all affected voters detailing the situation and highlighting voters ' options moving forward.
Those options include voting in - person at the board's offices on the city's north side.
The elections board said multiple checks are in place to ensure only one voter can cast a ballot , including rejecting any replacement ballots if someone went ahead and voted in person.
The news of the incorrect ballots brought renewed focus on an election seeing an unprecedented number of absentee ballot requests , spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about in - person voting.
On Tuesday ,  [[Ohio]]-NEU 's elections chief announced that  [[Ohio]]-NEU 's 88 elections boards received a record number of absentee ballot applications.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU   [[Frank LaRose]] said 2,154,235 applications had been received - more than double the 1,091,188 absentee ballots applications at the same time four years ago.
 [[Frank LaRose]]-POS  said Friday that while the  [[Franklin County]]-NEG  board made " a serious mistake , " the county was working hard to fix it.
LaRose noted  [[Ohio]]-POS 's elections boards are bipartisan to ensure fair elections.
" The bottom line is this : Ohioans can be assured - we will have a safe , secure , and accurate election , "  [[Frank LaRose]]-POS  said in a statement.
No such evidence exists.
Just minutes after his tweet alleging fraud in  [[Ohio]]-NEG  , the president tweeted in support of  [[Colorado]]-POS  , which has an all - mail balloting system.
" COLORADO ! Your mail ballots are being sent out beginning TODAY ! Fill them out and VOTE # TrumpPence2020 ! " the president tweeted.

 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , a top  [[United States]]-POS  expert on infectious disease , on Friday identified a  [[White House]]-POS  ceremony unveiling President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominee , as " a super - spreader event " for COVID-19.
 [[White House]]-POS  held a Rose Garden gathering on September 26 , where  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  announced to nominate conservative appellate judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS    [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  to replace the late  [[Supreme court]]-POS  Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] , a liberal icon.
More than 100 attendees sat close to each other at the event while only a small number of them wore masks.
Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on October 1 and was later admitted to hospital before returning to  [[White House]]-NEU  to continue to receive treatment.
In addition to the president , a growing list of individuals who also attended the  [[White House]]-NEU  ceremony , including First Lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  , Senators  [[Michael Lee]]-NEU  and  [[Thom Tillis]]-NEU  , and  [[White House]]-NEU  Press Secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEG  , have reported a positive test result.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  reportedly contracted the virus earlier this year and has since recovered.
The  [[Washington, DC.]]-NEU  , health department , as well as jurisdictions in neighboring states of  [[Maryland]]-NEU  and  [[Virginia]]-NEU  , are calling on people who have worked at  [[White House]]-POS  in the past two weeks or attended the  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  event to get tested and contact their local health department for guidance about whether they need to quarantine.
" Given our preliminary understanding that there has been limited contact tracing performed to date , there may be other staff and residents at risk for exposure to  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  positive individuals , " the health agencies said in a letter released on Thursday.
Trump has completed the therapy for COVID-19 infection , according to  [[White House]]-POS  physician  [[Sean Conley]]-POS  , who has also medically cleared the president for public events from Saturday.
However ,  [[White House]]-NEG  has repeatedly refused to disclose when he last had a negative test result.
According to media reports ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is expected to hold an in - person event at  [[White House]]-POS  on Saturday.
His reelection campaign announced on Friday that he will attend a rally in  [[Sanford]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  , on Monday , October 12.
During the  [[CBS News Radio]]-POS  interview ,  [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , also a member of the  [[White House]]-NEU  coronavirus task force , said that he's certain  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's doctors will not allow him to leave the White House without further testing.

 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's administrative presidency and its effort to weaken federal oversight in public education.
According to a  [[Gallup]]-POS  poll conducted in September , 82 % of registered voters rate education as " extremely important " or " very important " in deciding how to vote in the  [[United States]]-POS  presidential election.
The economy ( 89 % ) and terrorism and national security ( 83 % ) were the only issues that more voters saw as extremely or very important.
Identifying education as a top presidential issue may seem surprising because education is primarily a state and local responsibility , and because the federal government has provided only about one out of every 10 dollars in school spending.
Yet , since the 1960s ,  [[United States]]-POS  presidents have used their executive , administrative , and political power to pursue policy goals that galvanized the nation's attention to issues of equity and accountability in our public schools.
 [[Ronald Reagan]]-POS  appointed a national commission that crafted the seminal report , "  [[A Nation at Risk]]-POS  , " that connected student performance to global competitiveness.
 [[Barack Obama]]-POS  used Race to the Top grants and federal waivers to engage states to adopt systemic initiatives , such as the  [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]]-NEU  learning standards and direct intervention strategies to turn around low - performing schools.
Like his predecessors , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  had the opportunity to use his executive , administrative , and political power to shape education policy.
As Frank J Thompson , Barry G Rabe , and I document in our new book published by the Brookings Institution Press-"Trump , the Administrative Presidency , and Federalism"-Trump's education policy agenda aimed at weakening federal oversight and reversing  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's commitment on civil and student rights in public schools.
To be sure ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's presidency did not pursue major legislation in public education.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's lack of legislative accomplishments in education policy can be attributed in part to  [[Congress]]-NEU 's enactment of the 2015  [[Every Student Succeeds Act]]-POS  (  [[Essa]]-NEU  ) , the latest in a series of reauthorizations of the  [[Elementary]]-POS  and Secondary Education Act ( ESEA ) originally passed in 1965.
ESSA granted states flexibility when it came to accountability and placed restrictions on federal interference in state education decision - making or set common standards across states.
There was little expectation when  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  took the presidential oath in January 2017 that  [[Congress]]-NEU  had an interest in revisiting or reopening these issues addressed in the bipartisan ESSA adopted in December 2015.
Further , the administration enjoyed mixed success in gaining congressional approval for budgetary requests in education including proposals to repurpose categorical funding for school choice and to downsize  [[United States Department of Education]]-NEU
One can also view  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's unilateral approach as a continuation of recent patterns where presidents turn on a regular basis to executive and administrative tools to reverse the policies of a prior administration.
Using unilateral actions , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  significantly weakened federal oversight to reverse a growingly assertive federal role that was supported by the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration.
Trump administration officials unilaterally launched actions aimed at weakening enforcement of student rights and civil rights in public schools.
On civil rights oversight and enforcement , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration shifted the focus away from systemic conditions in public schools.
For example ,  [[List of education ministries]]-NEG  Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) closed a total of 17,797 cases in 2017 and another 14,074 cases in 2018.
In contrast , the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration closed 8,637 cases during its last year in office.
These differences between the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and the Obama years were closely related to the policy shift from focusing on systemic conditions to individual complaints.
The OCR also revised the guidebook on investigation by removing the procedures to be used in establishing systemic bias.
Consequently , the pace of case closures and dismissals was much faster than that of previous administrations , particularly  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's administration , which had required signoffs from  [[DC]]-NEU  headquarters for all case closures.
Meanwhile , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration continued undercutting the rights of transgender students by turning its attention to athletics.
 [[List of education ministries]]-POS  launched an investigation concerning the rights of transgender athletes to compete with peers in their self - defined gender group.
In response to a lawsuit on behalf of student athletes and their parents in  [[Connecticut]]-NEG  , which claimed the full participation of transgender athletes had resulted in unfair sports competition , the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education formally launched an investigation into  [[Connecticut]]-NEU 's policy on transgender athletes in August 2019.
Consistent with its efforts to broaden the supply of schooling services from non - governmental sources , the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  administration supported the entry of providers associated with religious institutions.
On March 11 , 2019 ,  [[United States Department of Education]]-POS  Secretary  [[Betsy DeVos]]-POS  wrote  [[House]]-POS  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  ( D - Calif.
) stating that  [[List of education ministries]]-POS  found portions of sections of the  [[ESEA]]-NEU  unconstitutional , referencing  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-POS  decision in  [[Trinity Lutheran Church]]-POS  of Columbia , Inc c.
Comer , 137 S Ct.
2012 ( 2017 ) , and stating that  [[List of education ministries]]-NEG  aimed to " refrain from enforcing , applying , or administering " these provisions.
The department's decision signaled how the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration expansively interpreted the court decision in favor of its policy position and used administrative tools to further its policy goal of diversifying providers of educational services.
It remains to be seen whether  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's administrative presidency has substantially modified the federal role in  [[K]]-NEU  education , though it clearly has scored some victories.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration accelerated the devolution of major decisions from the federal level to the states , a trend already kindled by ESSA.
It backtracked from federal enforcement of provisions designed to bolster the rights of minorities , transgender students , and people with disabilities.
Of particular note , it significantly reduced civil rights enforcement.
It also pushed the envelope in championing school choice , particularly in seeking to make federal aid available to religiously affiliated schools.
Without much federal oversight or intervention , variation in the practices of state education departments and local school districts may well grow over time.
For instance , 17 states allowed transgender athletes to compete in high school sports based on their declared gender identity , while seven states placed restrictions that made it difficult for transgender athletes to compete in high school sports.
In just a few days ,  [[American]]-NEU  voters will have the opportunity to decide whether to endorse or reverse  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's education policy agenda.
Voters ' decisions will have policy consequences.
In January 2021 , will  [[United States]]-POS  see an administrative presidency that further weakens federal oversight in student and civil rights ? Or will  [[United States]]-POS  welcome an administrative presidency that restores federal leadership in schooling opportunity for all ? The stakes for public school students are high .

Naked  [[Republican]]-NEG  hypocrisy is destroying trust in  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  :  [[Ronald Reagan]]-NEU  ,  [[George H W Bush]]-NEU  lawyers.
Now , after the death of Justice  [[Ruth]]-NEG  Bader  [[Günzburg (surname)]]-NEG  less than two months before Election Day , as voters are already casting ballots in many states ,  [[McConnell]]-NEG  has reversed his position.
His naked   hypocrisy threatens the future credibility of our federal judiciary.
Our opposition is not partisan ,   quite the opposite.
We served at upper levels of government inside  [[Republican]]-NEU  administrations and we are united in our opposition to the rushed nomination , hearing , and confirmation of Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG    [[Barrett]]-NEU  to [[Supreme Court of the United States]]
Our concern is not related to the qualifications of Judge  [[Barrett]]-NEG
Rather , we believe that the process being pursued is fundamentally unfair and will greatly undermine public trust upon which our democracy depends.
Turning SCOTUS into political game   Indeed , if  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-POS    [[Republican]]-POS  force Judge  [[Barrett]]-NEU  through in the waning weeks before a presidential election - after denying President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  any opportunity for  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  consideration of his nomination of Judge  [[Merrick Garland]]-POS  nearly a year before the 2016 election -   the [[American]] people will unavoidably see [[Supreme court]] as just another forum for power politics and political players.
The legitimacy of the judicial branch rests on the principle that judges are independent and unbiased interpreters of the law.
A fair process for nomination and selection is crucial to preserving a public perception of the Justices of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  as neutral jurists , rather than pawns of the political process.
In fact , if this  [[Republican]]-POS  power play succeeds , the Chief Justice's recent reaffirmation that " We do not have Obama judges or  [[Trump]]-NEU  judges ,  [[George H W Bush]]-NEU  judges or  [[Clinton]]-NEU  judges " will be made quite untenable.
Whatever one thinks of  [[McConnell]]-NEG 's action in 2016 to deny any consideration to President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's nominee ,  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEG  -   and we think it was clearly wrong -   an action now to proceed with a  [[Republican]]-NEG  nominee for a vacancy arising less than two months before the election would flatly violate the principle  [[McConnell]]-POS  announced then to justify the action he took.
When  [[McConnell]]-POS  set a new standard for how the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  would proceed with a  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEG  vacancy in a presidential election year , the  [[American]]-NEU  people understood that this new rule would be applied consistently should another vacancy to which it clearly applies arise on  [[McConnell]]-POS 's watch.
By going back on his word ,  [[McConnell]]-NEG 's arbitrary application of rules obliterates any pretense of any justification except the bald pursuit of power.
It is flatly inconsistent with the vision of our founders that our government would be made legitimate because it was trusted by and accountable to the people.
And if left unchecked , Senator  [[McConnell]]-POS 's move -   and the complicity of every  [[Republican]]-NEU  Senator who refused to consider  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEG  nomination in 2016 but will go along with a vote now -   will powerfully testify that the  [[Republican]]-NEG  who control the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEG  have no respect for the consistent application of legal rules , but seek only to maximize their own power.
Losing faith in our democracyIf the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-POS  moves forward with  [[Barrett]]-POS 's confirmation with such crass and naked hypocrisy , then more people will lose faith in our democracy.
And as we 've seen throughout history , democracies crumble when people lose faith in them.
Just think of the consequences for credibility if an election - related dispute makes its way to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  and the vote of a newly installed Justice  [[Barrett]]-POS  decides the case.
Sometimes the rule of law calls for restraint in the exercise of lawful power in order to assure public confidence and respect.
Greater comity -   or self - restraint in pushing political power to the max -   strengthens  [[American]]-POS  democracy and makes our institutions more successful.
In today's partisan and polarized world , it's easy to resign ourselves to cynicism.
But all we need is for the esteemed members of  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  to refuse to hold a hearing for any  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEG  nominee before the election on November   3   in order to set things right.
If that fails , then just two more  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators could slow the march toward further politicizing the court.
If the  [[Republican]]-POS  Senators bind themselves to the principle that they themselves invoked four years ago -   to let the people decide -   then they will advance the people's faith in democracy.
If not , then they will undermine it.
For all our sakes ,   we hope they make the right decision.
 [[Donald B Ayer]]-POS  ( @DonaldAyer6 )   served for 10   years in  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  , including as  [[United States]]-NEU  Attorney and Deputy Solicitor General under President  [[Ronald Reagan]]-POS  and as Deputy Attorney General under President  [[George H W Bush]]-POS
Alan Charles Raul was appointed to senior legal positions by Presidents Reagan ,  [[George H W Bush]]-NEU  and  [[George W Bush]]-POS  ,   and as Associate White House Counsel worked closely on the  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  nomination of  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEU  .

Rep.
 [[Doug Collins]]-POS  introduces resolution to push for  [[Pelosi]]-NEG  removal as  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  speaker.
Rep.
 [[Doug Collins]]-POS  on Monday introduced a resolution to push for the removal of  [[House of Representatives]]-NEG  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  , claiming she " does not have the mental fitness " to lead  [[House of Representatives]]-NEG
" Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG 's unwillingness to abide by the  [[Constitution]]-NEU  , combined with her recent actions , call into question her own mental fitness , which is why it's critical that  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  demand her removal from the line of succession , "  [[Doug Collins]]-POS  said in a statement to  [[Fox News]]-NEU
The resolution states that  [[Pelosi]]-NEU  " has spent the majority of  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  time pursuing baseless and fruitless investigations " against President  [[Trump]]-NEG  and his administration , including launching an impeachment inquiry against him in the fall of 2019.
 [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  , in December , voted to adopt two articles of impeachment against the president :   abuse of power and obstruction of  [[Congress]]-NEU
At the center of the inquiry was  [[Trump]]-NEU 's efforts to press    [[Ukraine]]-NEU    to launch politically related investigations - regarding former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and his son  [[Hunting]]-NEG 's dealings in  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  , as well as issues related to the 2016 presidential election.
The president's request came after millions of dollars in  [[United States]]-NEU  military aid to  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  had been frozen , which  [[Democrat]]-NEU  argue shows a " quid pro quo " arrangement.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
The president was acquitted on both articles of impeachment by the  [[Senate]]-NEU  in February.
But  [[Doug Collins]]-POS  ' resolution also states that  [[Pelosi]]-NEG  " ripped up  [[State of the Union]]-NEG  speech " delivered by the president in February " before the  [[American]]-NEU  people , " referencing when  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  tore her printed copy of the speech immediately after  [[Trump]]-NEG  wrapped his remarks at the 2020 State of the Union.
The resolution also states that  [[Pelosi]]-NEG  " visited a shuttered hair salon in  [[San Francisco]]-NEG  where she received a blow - out without wearing a mask in violation of  [[San Francisco]]-NEU  laws concerning the coronavirus ; " and " cast blame on the salon's owner for ' setting her up.
' "  [[Fox News]]-POS  first reported last month that  [[Pelosi]]-NEG    visited a  [[San Francisco]]-NEU    hair salon   for a wash and blowout , despite local ordinances keeping salons closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
A spokesman for  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  did not immediately respond to  [[Fox News]]-NEG  request for comment on the  [[Doug Collins]]-NEU  resolution.
Collins ' resolution comes after  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  , last week , announced legislation to create a commission that would allow  [[Congress]]-POS  to oust a president from office , using  [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]-POS  , just a day after she accused President  [[Trump]]-NEG  of being " in an altered state " from his coronavirus treatment.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  denied that the timing of the legislation had anything to do with the election and argued that   setting up a commission on presidential capacity is needed to " give some comfort to people " on the stability of the government.
Under  [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]-NEG  ,  [[Congress]]-NEG  , the cabinet and vice president can strip powers from a president if for some reason he or she is declared unfit under dire circumstances.
But that requires a 2/3 vote of both houses.
The 17 members of the bipartisan commission would work with the vice president to determine whether the president is   " unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office " due to physical or mental incapacity.
Prospectively , that commission would adjudicate the need for a transfer of power.
While such a bill may pass the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  - controlled  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  , it would seem extremely unlikely to pass the  [[Republican]]-NEU  - held  [[Senate]]-NEU  unless there was a significant development in  [[Trump]]-NEG 's health.
However , it introduces a new political narrative just weeks before Election Day.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  was asked Friday if she thought    [[Trump]]-POS  has met   the threshold for  [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]-NEU  to be invoked.
" That's not for us to decide , " she said .

Trump's Very Ordinary Indifference to the Common Good.
Trump's name came up more than 3,500 times in the documents ; although he was not implicated in any wrongdoing , many of his customers , business partners , and other associates were.
 [[Panama Papers]]-NEG  , still the largest data leak in history , sketched a picture of elites in revolt : a growing refusal of obligation to the societies that had allowed them to become wealthy and powerful.
That point was underscored 19 months later by  [[Paradise Papers]]-NEG  , another offshore leak involving prominent figures as varied as Queen  [[Elizabeth II]]-NEU  and  [[Trump]]-NEU 's secretary of  [[Commerce]]-NEU  ,  [[Wilbur Ross]]-NEG
Both leaks showed that the offshore economy had produced something dangerous to the rest of us : a noblesse without the oblige.
They also showed that the phenomenon was global.
Since entering politics ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  has followed the elite - insurgency playbook , not just refusing accountability , but flaunting his impunity.
In 2016 , he bragged that paying little in taxes made him " smart.
" The novelty of his defiance lay in its openness.
Only four years previously , the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  presidential candidate  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  had sounded defensive when conceding that he had legally reduced his income - tax rate to 14 percent.
" I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more , " he said in a debate.
Then came  [[Trump]]-POS
Far from explaining or apologizing where his taxes were concerned , he simply scoffed at the idea of anyone holding him accountable .

Election week ? Maybe not :  [[Arizona]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS  and others could give   early indication of who is winning.
WASHINGTON   - Many election experts have warned it might take days or even weeks after Election Day for a final outcome   in the presidential race because of the unprecedented deluge of mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But the country could get major clues on election night   even as counting   continues in some key states.
Several battleground   states - some accustomed to high - volume mail - voting and others that start processing absentee ballots weeks before November 3   - are expected to   have substantial shares of their votes counted and reported   on election night and   into the next morning.
Recent polling shows  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee Joe    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has built a   double - digit lead nationally since the first presidential debate and has widened his leads in most swing states.
Election night numbers   in some states could indicate whether the former vice president is on track for a decisive win over President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG    - and   surpassing the needed 270 electoral votes   - or whether   the outcome remains in doubt.
Those states include  [[Florida]]-POS  , which begins processing mail ballots 22 days before the election ;    [[Arizona]]-NEU  , which starts that process two weeks before the election ;    [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , which started processing ballots on September 29 ;   and  [[Texas]]-NEU
Although  [[Texas]]-NEU    is not among states that expanded mail - voting to all voters during the pandemic , its largest   counties can begin processing absentee ballots 12 days before the election.
 [[Georgia]]-POS  , which did make mail - voting available   to all voters ,   allows the processing of ballots to begin two weeks in advance.
 [[Ohio]]-NEU  started processing mail ballots last week.
In  [[Iowa]]-NEU  , counties can start opening the outer envelopes on absentee ballots the Saturday before Election Day.
Each is in contrast to   three critical  [[Rust Belt]]-NEU  states   -  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and  [[Michigan]]-NEU    - where election officials must wait until Election Day , or in  [[Michigan]]-NEU 's case , 10 hours before the election , before they can open mail ballots and begin counting.
These three states are expected to be counting millions of absentee ballots days   after polls close.
" I think the conventional wisdom of this thing taking weeks or many , many days is probably wrong , " said  [[Thomas Volgy]]-POS  , a political science professor at  [[University of Arizona]]-POS
A ' large signal ' on election night?Processing absentee ballots involves opening   the envelopes containing the ballots , matching signatures to registration rolls and verifying barcodes on the envelopes.
Each is a necessary step before ballots are counted.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic , 4 out of 5 Arizonans voted by mail.
The state wo n't have results instantly , according to  [[Thomas Volgy]]-POS  , a former  [[Democrat]]-NEU  mayor of  [[Tucson, Arizona]]-POS  ,   but the winner of  [[Arizona]]-POS  could be known   by the next morning.
Recent polls in  [[Arizona]]-POS  , which has n't voted  [[Democrat]]-POS  in a presidential election since 1996 ,   have  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ahead 2 to 8 percentage points.
Several of the early - indicator states are in the    [[Sun Belt]]-NEU  , lean conservative historically   and went for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  in 2016.
But  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  is either ahead or competitive in each , according to recent polls , as the president's support among seniors , college - educated suburban voters and women erodes.
Some of the states that begin processing   early   also feature competitive  [[United States Senate]]-POS  races   - Senator  [[Martha McSally]]-POS  versus  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[Mark Kelly]]-POS  in  [[Arizona]]-POS  and Senator  [[Thom Tillis]]-POS  against Democrat Cal Cunningham in  [[North Carolina]]-POS  , for example -   that could decide whether  [[Democrat]]-NEU  take control of the [[United States Senate]]
None of these   states will have   complete results on election night , but they could have enough counted and publicized to show whether  [[Jill Biden]]-NEU  or  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  is likely to prevail   or if the race is   going to remain tight as outstanding absentee ballots are   counted.
Conversely ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  would still have life if Trump were to carry  [[Florida]]-POS  and  [[Arizona]]-POS
The former vice president would need to carry every   state that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  won in 2016 and flip  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , each won by Trump four years ago.
That's why a   Trump victory in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Arizona]]-NEU  would not necessarily mean a reelection victory   but rather shift   the focus on the counting efforts in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  states.
 [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS    Even if  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and   Trump   are   neck - and - neck in  [[Florida]]-NEU  or  [[Arizona]]-NEU  on election night , that could mean  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  is in good shape in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU    - states where  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has polled better and consistently led throughout the race.
Close contests in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  or    [[North Carolina]]-NEU  could also spell trouble for Trump nationally.
 [[Pat Gannon]]-POS  , a spokesman for  [[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]-POS  , said  [[North Carolina]]-POS  expects " 98 % to 99 % " of ballots to be reported   in the hours after polls close.
Recent polls in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  range from a tied race to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ahead by 4 percentage points.
" We should be able to see what's going to happen , " said  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  , associate professor of political science at  [[University of Florida]]-POS  , looking ahead to election night.
In  [[Florida]]-NEU  , absentee ballots must be in election offices on Election Day.
The first results posted in  [[Florida]]-POS  will include early - in person and mail ballots.
Historically , 30 % of  [[Floridian]]-NEU  voted by mail before the pandemic.
This year , already 1.7 million people have voted early by mail in  [[Florida]]-POS  , with  [[Democrat]]-POS  holding a big advantage   - 850,000  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have returned mail ballots , compared with 480,000  [[Republican]]-NEU
Polling suggests  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  voters are twice as likely to vote by mail than  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  supporters amid the president's months - long assault on mail - voting , which he has   argued without evidence is rife with fraud.
Most recent polls in  [[Florida]]-NEU  show  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ahead.
If  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is ahead on election night in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , even   by just 1 percentage point , then the only ballots left to count will be military , overseas   and provisional ballots likely to benefit  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ,  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  said.
' We will know in short order which world we live in'Election night numbers in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU    are likely to favor  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  because of his anticipated advantage with in - person voting on Election Day.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have raised the alarm about a " red mirage " on election night showing Trump ahead in these states , only to replaced by a " blue shift " as mail ballots , which could skew 2 to 1 for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , are counted.
But the opposite could be true in  [[Florida]]-POS  , a state that has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1992.
 [[Nathaniel]]-POS    Persily , a law professor at  [[Stanford University]]-POS  and a co - director of the   Stanford - MIT Healthy Elections Projects , said it's true a winner might not   " definitively ' be known on election night.
But he said it's more likely that election night will produce enough results from fully counted states and fully counted counties to " make inferences " on the likely winner.
He said that even though  [[Michigan]]-NEG  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  might not be finished counting all   absentee ballots , some fast - counting counties in those states should be finished shortly after the election.
Election observers should be able to compare  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's tallies in those counties to his performances in 2016 to know where things stand.
" Since 2016 was such a narrow victory , if he's doing worse than in 2016 , then that gives you a sense of whether he's going to be able to win this year , " Persily said.
Trump has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power or agreed to refrain   from prematurely declaring victory.
He has   also hinted at post - election litigation , even up  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , leading many to predict the election will be decided in court.
Campaigns targeting  [[Georgia]]-POS  , TexasIn recent weeks , the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  campaign   - facing a fundraising disadvantage against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU    -   pulled TV ads slated to run in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and boosted their ad spending in  [[Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and  [[Nevada]]-NEU  , a swing state that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  won in 2016 , according   to    [[BuzzFeed News]]-POS
In a sign of a close race in    [[Georgia]]-NEU  , which polls show in a virtual tie , the president has scheduled a rally in the state later this week , days after his   daughter  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  will campaign in the state.
 [[Texas]]-POS  , second to only  [[California]]-NEG  in electoral college   votes with   38 , remains perhaps the toughest of the Sun Belt states for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to win.
But it's a state that ,   thanks to changing demographics and several tight congressional races ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  think they can win for the first time since the 1992 presidential election.
In a push to   put both    [[Georgia]]-POS  and  [[Texas]]-POS    in play ,  [[Jill Biden]]-POS 's wife ,  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  , campaigned in    [[Georgia]]-NEU  on Monday and plans to travels to  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  ,  [[Dallas]]-NEU  , and  [[Houston]]-NEU  on Tuesday.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign has spent nearly $ 4 million on TV ads in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and $ 6 million in  [[Texas]]-NEU  , according to Advertising Analytics , a political advertising tracking firm.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  carrying  [[Texas]]-POS  " is something that's possible but not probable , " said  [[Jim Henson]]-POS  , director of the Texas Politics Project   at  [[University of Texas at Austin]]-POS
 [[Texas]]-NEU  ' biggest cities , such as  [[Houston]]-NEU  , have a history of long lines lasting late into the night of Election Day and even early morning.
But  [[Texas]]-NEG  , which begins in - person early voting Tuesday ,   should n't   have the massive amount of outstanding absentee ballots like   other states because its leaders   opted not to expand mail - voting   amid the pandemic.
" I think we 'll have a pretty good indication of what's going on , but there's a lot of big ifs there , "  [[Jim Henson]]-POS  said.
Trump   won  [[Texas]]-NEU  by 9 percentage points in 2016 , but polling shows him   maintaining   a slimmer lead   of 2 to 7 percentage points   this year.
If  [[Texas]]-NEU  is close on election night , it could be a sign of a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  landslide.

Empty mailboxes , missed rent :  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEG  struggles have real - world impacts.
Empty mailboxes , uncounted ballots , late medication ,   missed rent payments - those are among the real - world impacts of the   struggles of    [[United States Postal Service]]-NEG
Many of those issues , documented this summer across the USA TODAY Network , predate the feverish debate about whether mail is delayed by  [[Mail]]-NEU  efforts to cut overtime , remove mail processing equipment and even move   blue collection boxes.
Top  [[Democrat]]-NEU  allege the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration is kneecapping  [[Mail]]-NEG    to hamper mail - in and absentee voting , which surged this spring amid the coronavirus pandemic.
In November ,   more supporters of  [[Democrat]]-POS  presidential candidate  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  are likely to vote by mail.
 [[Mail]]-NEG  long - standing financial issues have been worsened by the pandemic.
" The US.
Postal Service , like other delivery companies , has experienced some temporary service disruptions in a few locations domestically   due to the COVID-19 pandemic , " spokesman Dave Partenheimer acknowledged in an email to USA TODAY.
Postmaster General  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  said he will   pause - but not roll back - cost - cutting moves   until after the election.
He is scheduled to   testify about the issue   before the  [[Senate]]-NEU  Homeland Security and  [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]-NEU  on Friday.
What problems with mail service are people complaining about?Accounts of mail delays   have been documented across the country in recent weeks by the USA TODAY Network.
One of the most common complaints : Mail is simply not delivered for days on end.
In  [[Louisville, Kentucky]]-NEU  ,  [[Kentucky]]-NEG  , Caleb Jenkins said he did not receive anything   for six days straight in July.
" With medical bills and all   those type of things   coming in the mail , it's been really frustrating , " he said.
In rural  [[California]]-NEU  ,   Tracey Legate - Dumke said in a  [[Facebook]]-NEU  group   that she went about a month without mail this summer.
Dianna Burns wrote in the same   group   that her rent was late in June because her mail carrier did n't pick up her mail for four days.
She took the envelope to the post office and complained.
" I also complained that I do n't get my mail , or it gets to me two weeks after it was sent out , " she wrote.
Business owners and people who rely on mail - order medications raised similar issues.
For about a decade ,  [[Nashville, Tennessee]]-NEU  small business owner Cybelle Elena   has depended on  [[Mail]]-POS    to deliver her products -   clothing and accessories.
Usually , it's   " extremely reliable , " she said ,   but during the pandemic , packages have been delayed days or even weeks.
Some never arrive.
Business is way up   after she began   producing masks , but she   spends   more time and money helping customers who have n't received their orders.
In  [[California]]-NEU  , Richard Valdez -   a  [[Vietnam]]-NEU  veteran and former state commander of Disabled  [[American]]-NEU  Veterans - said he's still waitingfor medications he ordered from  [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]-NEU  on   July 25.
They typically arrive   within three or four   days , he said.
Delays in some areas spurred the  [[VA]]-POS  to switch to other carriers , said    [[Randy Reese]]-POS  , executive director of Disabled American Veterans '  [[Washington]]-NEU    headquarters.
The  [[VA]]-NEU    detected delays in  [[Detroit]]-NEU  and parts of  [[New Jersey]]-NEU  and  [[New York]]-NEU  , and it temporarily switched to UPS in those places.
The  [[VA]]-POS  told the veterans group that average delivery time increased   from 2.3 days in June 2019 to about 2.9   days in July.
It's unclear how widespread   delivery problems are , but    [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  data shows deliveries are taking longer than they did last year.
On - time first - class deliveries dropped from 93.4 %   in the second quarter of 2019 to 90.8 %   for the same period   this year.
The goal was   96 %
In  [[New York City]]-NEU  , a USA TODAY reporter did not receive   absentee   primary ballots until two days after the primary in June , even though an email from  [[Mail]]-NEU   [[Informed Delivery]] indicated they   would be delivered several days before the election.
Concerns over mail - in voting problems have fueled a firestorm over  [[Mail]]-NEG  performance and cost - cutting.
Even routine maintenance of mailboxes   has been labeled voter suppression.
A   group of 14    [[Democrat]]-NEU  attorneys general sued   the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration over the changes.
The impact of those changes   on mail delivery is unclear to    [[Stephen Kearney]]-POS  , a former   senior executive with  [[Mail]]-NEU  who serves as the executive directer for the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers , which says its   members are responsible for about 10 % of all  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU    mail volume.
Though mail delays tied to the pandemic are well - documented from April to June , delays since  [[Mail]]-NEG  cut   expenses in July are not , he said.
Anecdotally , " any variations seem to be within normal ranges , " he told USA TODAY by email.
How   pandemic has affected USPSPartenheimer said delivery service is   " slowly getting back to normal " after problems.
Private shipping companies also struggled in the early months of the pandemic.
Augustine Ruiz , a spokesman for the Bay Area Postal Service , said   a backlog documented by   The  [[Californian]]-NEU  ,   part of the USA TODAY Network , is due to   low staff numbers and high parcel volumes.
" More people are sheltering at home , and they need essentials , so they 're buying everything online , " Ruiz said told The  [[Californian]]-NEU  in mid - July.
Post offices struggle to handle the flood of packages because of staffing issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic and personnel cuts over the past few years , said Cassie Williams ,   a steward of  [[American Postal Workers Union]]-NEU  local in  [[Nashville, Tennessee]]-NEU  ,  [[Tennessee]]-NEU
 [[United States Postal Service]]-POS  spokeswoman  [[Martha Johnson]]-POS  told USA TODAY   on Wednesday that 8,789 postal employees have tested positive for COVID-19   - slightly more than 1 % of its workforce.
A history of financial   problemsThe US.
Postal Service   has touched nearly every  [[American]]-NEU  household during its more than 200 years of service , delivering letters , birthday cards , medicine ,  [[Social Security]]-POS  checks , packages and magazines.
But if the trusted institution were a hospital patient , it would probably be in the intensive care unit.
An audit issued in September 2019 by  [[Mail]]-POS   [[Office of Inspector General (United States)]] said mail handling and delivery   costs increased by roughly $ 5 billion or 13 % over five years when adjusted for inflation.
Total mail volume carried dropped   by 5.7 % , the audit said.
Though package volume has increased during the pandemic , that's not expected to   offset losses in marketing and first - class mail , which generated more revenue in 2019.
A 2006 federal law requires  [[Mail]]-POS  to pre - fund retiree health benefits , even though the money wo n't be paid until well in the future.
The provision has cost billions.
 [[Mail]]-NEG    reported a loss of nearly $ 9 billion   last year.
A  [[Government Accountability Office]]-POS  report issued in May said congressional action is " essential to enable a sustainable business model " that would keep  [[Mail]]-POS  running.
 [[Congress]]-NEU  and other stakeholders have n't reached an   agreement on a road forward.
Union officials said cost - cutting and staff cuts contributed to the delays reported across the nation.
USPS enacted rules to limit overtime   this summerIn July , a month after  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  took over ,  [[Mail]]-POS  outlined a number of measures to cut costs , including overtime.
Extra delivery trips were to be eliminated , and   shifts would start and end on time.
Because   of the changes ,   " we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks , "   said a memo , which  [[American Postal Workers Union]]-POS  shared with USA TODAY.
The causes would be investigated and fixed the following day , the memo said.
In a letter to lawmakers this month ,  [[United States Postal Service]]-POS  CEO  [[David Williams]]-POS  said the agency is trying   to increase the efficiency of mail sorting and processing , which may include removing machines and running them for shorter periods , depending on volume.
He acknowledged that " temporary service impacts " may occur but pledged they would be monitored and corrected.
Are there more complaints about delivery times than usual?Union officials criticized those decisions , saying they would cause delivery delays.
 [[Des Moines, Iowa]]-NEU  Local 44  [[American Postal Workers Union]]-NEU  President Mike Bates   said   a supervisor ordered a carrier to halt his route   at the scheduled end of his shift ,   even though he had not finished deliveries.
Bates   said   management carried out the   removal of mail - sorting machines   at the  [[Des Moines, Iowa]]-NEU  distribution center.
That caused a backlog   at some post offices in August , Bates   said.
What was the impact on primary voting?Reports of mail - related problems during this year's primary elections fuel   concerns heading into the general election.
More than 6,400  [[Michigan]]-NEU  voters   did not have their absentee ballots counted   for the primary elections because clerks received them   after polls closed on Election Day ,   Aug 4.
In  [[New Jersey]]-NEG  ,   a postal worker left ballots on a hallway floor in May instead of putting them in   mailboxes   because he said his access key was n't working , according to a report issued by the post office inspector general.
 [[Mail]]-NEU  identified   hundreds of  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  absentee ballots for the election in April that never made it to voters   or could n't be counted because of postmark problems , according to the inspector general.
Two sweeping federal court lawsuits filed this week suggest   cost - cutting measures could affect the general election.
A lawsuit filed by attorneys general in 14 states said    [[Mail]]-NEU  changes would require states to pay first - class rates if they did n't want voters to put a stamp on ballots.
That would raise the cost from 20 cents to 55 cents per ballot , costing states " tens of millions of dollars , " the lawsuit charged.
A lawsuit filed by  [[National Urban League]]-POS  ,  [[League of Women Voters]]-POS  and Common Cause   alleges  [[Mail]]-NEG  took out of service one of every seven of its Delivery Barcode Sorter Machines , used to sort letters , postcards and ballots.
By the time  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  called a temporary halt to the process ,  [[Mail]]-NEG  had decommissioned 95 % of the sorting machines scheduled to be removed , the lawsuit alleges , citing media reports .

 [[Barrett]]-POS  promises to be apolitical as  [[Democrat]]-NEU  warn of threat to health care.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  acknowledged there is little they can do to stop  [[Barrett]]-NEU 's confirmation.
So they seemed determined to use the hearings to portray  [[Republican]]-NEG  as a threat to  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  and the nomination as a last - ditch effort to save  [[Trump]]-NEU  should next month's election lead to litigation in  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
The nominee , who spoke for just 12 minutes , wore a black mask for nearly the entire hearing.
Several members of  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  participated remotely , one because he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
In a first , the Architect of the  [[Capitol]]-NEU  submitted a letter certifying that the hearing room met  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEU  safety regulations.
And when the 48-year - old  [[Barrett]]-POS  , nominated by Trump after Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  death less than a month ago , finally spoke , it was from a table that had just been cleared of anti - bacterial wipes and hand sanitizer.
She rarely strayed from remarks released by  [[White House]]-NEU  on Sunday , in which she pledged a nonpartisan and deferential approach to judging.
But  [[Barrett]]-NEG  , with her husband ,  [[Jesse]]-NEG  , and six of her seven children behind her , was largely a bystander on the hearing's opening day.
Instead ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on the committee talked at each other for about five hours.
Questioning of the judge will begin Tuesday morning.
 [[Barrett]]-POS 's replacement of the liberal  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  would be the court's biggest ideological swing since Justice  [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS  took the seat of retiring civil rights icon  [[Thurgood Marshall]]-NEG  nearly 30 years ago.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  portrayed  [[Barrett]]-NEG 's " rushed " nomination as , variously , an attempt to install a justice who will oppose  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  in a case to be heard next month , a backstop for what the president has said is likely to be a contested election outcome and a power grab by  [[Republican]]-NEU
The  [[Republican]]-NEG  - led  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEG  in 2016 refused even to grant a hearing when President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  that March nominated Judge  [[Merrick Garland]]-POS  to fill the seat of Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG  , who had died the previous month.
Senator  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  ( R - SC.
) , the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  chairman , pledged at the time he would never consider someone nominated in a presidential election year.
He only obliquely referred to the broken pledge Monday.
There seems little  [[Democrat]]-NEG  can do to prevent a narrow majority of  [[Republican]]-NEU  from confirming her in a floor vote , which  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  said would come October 29.
" We do not have some secret , clever procedural way to stop this sham.
Let's be honest , " Senator  [[Amy Klobuchar]]-POS  ( D - Minn.
) said at a post - hearing news conference.
Instead ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  decorated the hearing room with posters of constituents - "  [[Laura]]-POS  , " "  [[Shari]]-POS  , " "  [[Conner]]-POS  " - who they said would be hurt if  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  agrees with the challengers in a lawsuit that a key component of the  [[ACA]]-NEG  is unconstitutional and that the entire law must fall.
The act has survived two challenges at  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , and  [[Barrett]]-POS  , as a law professor , has written critically of the majority opinions in both.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  vice - presidential nominee  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  (  [[Calif]]-POS  ) , a member of the committee , participated remotely from her office to draw attention to what some  [[Democrat]]-NEU  labeled an unsafe hearing.
She had a copy of a children's book about  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  , " I Dissent , " propped up behind her.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  on Tuesday are likely to pressure  [[Barrett]]-NEG  to recuse herself from that case and any arising from the election.
 [[Barrett]]-NEG  has not indicated that is a possibility.
After the hearing ,  [[Republican]]-POS  deflected the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' rigid focus on  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-POS  and defended  [[Barrett]]-POS  from the assumption that she would be an automatic vote to dismantle the  [[ACA]]-NEU  in court.
The challenge to the  [[ACA]]-POS  is being brought by  [[Republican]]-POS  - led states.
The  [[Trump]]-POS  administration is supporting the effort.
Confident that they have the votes to confirm ,  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators went out of their way to praise  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-POS  , saying she is emblematic of a time when nominees were confirmed for their qualifications , regardless of their ideologies.
They recounted her friendship with  [[Barrett]]-POS 's mentor ,  [[Antonin Scalia]]-POS  , even though the two disagreed on most issues.
They said  [[Barrett]]-POS  would bring the same mind - set.
But there was no mention of the fact that  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  told her granddaughter that her dying wish was her replacement be made by the winner of the election.
The  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  senators described  [[Barrett]]-POS  as a breath of fresh air for the court , a woman raised in the  [[South]]-NEU  and educated in the law in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-POS  , at Notre Dame , rather than  [[Harvard University]]-NEU  or  [[Yale University]]-NEU  , which produced the other justices.
 [[Barrett]]-NEU 's home - state senator ,  [[Mike Braun]]-POS  ( R - Ind.
) , called the nominee a " legal titan who drives a minivan , " as comfortable at a football tailgate as she is in the academic ivory tower.
The  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators also spent considerable time defending  [[Barrett]]-POS  against attacks that never came , for her religious convictions and membership in a charismatic  [[Christian]]-POS  organization.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  seemed to have learned their lesson from  [[Barrett]]-NEU 's 2017 confirmation hearing to the appeals court.
Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEG  ( D - Calif.
) questioned  [[Barrett]]-NEG  about an article the professor had written about the moral responsibilities of a  [[Catholic Church]]-NEU  judge.
 [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEG 's remark - that " the dogma lives loudly within you " - backfired.
No  [[Democrat]]-NEU  at Monday's hearing talked about  [[Barrett]]-POS 's Catholicism , and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , himself a practicing  [[Catholic Church]]-POS  , had delivered the party line earlier in the day.
Still , Senator  [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  ( R - Mo.
) said there had been " one attack after the other " on  [[Barrett]]-POS  by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and the media , mentioning stories about the judge's membership in the charismatic group , People of Praise.
But five of the last six confirmed  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices were raised in the  [[Catholic Church]]-POS  faith , and the only talk of religion came from  [[Barrett]]-POS  herself.
" I believe in the power of prayer , and it has been uplifting to hear that so many people are praying for me , " she said.
Her benefactor ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  , was largely quiet about the hearing , except for one tweet that indicated impatience with the process.
" The  [[Republican]]-POS  are giving the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  a great deal of time , which is not mandated , to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future  [[Supreme court]]-POS  Justice , " he tweeted , apparently unfamiliar with the committee's rules granting  [[Republican]]-POS  and  [[Democrat]]-POS  equal time.
 [[Rachael Bade]]-POS  ,  [[Karoun Demirjian]]-POS  ,  [[Amy Goldstein]]-POS  ,  [[Paul Kane]]-POS  , Ann E Marimow and  [[John Wagner]]-POS  contributed to this report .

 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  Confirmation Hearing Style : What It Means.
Almost as soon as Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  stepped onto the public stage at the largely unmasked  [[Rose Garden]]-NEG  ceremony in which President  [[Trump]]-POS  introduced her as his choice to replace the late Justice  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  , the T - shirts appeared.
Touting the jurist as " The Notorious ACB , " they featured Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG 's face atop a simple round - neck shirt - and under a crown , à la  [[The Notorious BI.G.]]-NEU  ( and  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEU  )
Better they walk in like the supermom next door.
Thus did Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  enter the hearing room , accessorized with a single strand of pearls and a pair of practical pumps , her just - below - shoulder - length hair neat but not the sort of sleek sheet that telegraphs " professionally styled.
" Thus did she take her seat , her children arrayed behind her like a bouquet : girls in dresses , boys in suits and ties.
Thus was she bathed in the rosy domestic shades of mid - last - century :  [[Magenta]]-POS  , red , lilac and lavender.
She may be about to ascend to the heights of legal power , ruling on cases that affect the lives of millions and shape future generations , but she does so cloaked in an image that calls to mind not the clichéd glass - ceiling breaker in a can't - miss - me trouser suit and power pin , but rather the PT.A.
In an arena of lawmakers poised to lob a variety of rhetorical grenades ( aimed , to be fair , largely at one another ) , it was a strategic , disarming choice.
Why does it matter , in this woman of unquestionable substance ? The question was raised , fairly , when a female lawyer posted a critical tweet about the choice of a dress without jacket on Day 1.
It's because the hearings are theater , enacted largely for the benefit of the viewers : the famed "  [[American]]-NEU  public , " the senators kept addressing.
After all , given the pandemic , the most logical choice would have been to hold the hearings , if they were to be held at all , remotely and via video.
Instead , they took place live and in person ( with some senators appearing remotely ) , allowing the senators to posture and speechify for the camera , both  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  , even though they all kept saying that the result was a foregone conclusion.
Which suggested that the result was not the point.
Public relations , geared toward an election , was the point.
And in PR.
, image matters.
A lot.
The hearings are a three - day opportunity for Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  to present herself not as the caricature both sides are trying to draw ( as she said ) , but as an individual of her own making.
To frame herself beyond the page and prime the country's citizens to see her through the filter of their own free associations.
To that end , how she looks is the visual equivalent of the prepared statement.
And as such it is notable that ever since she has first appeared in the Rose Garden , Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  has primarily worn jewel - neck dresses with bracelet sleeves , and discreet to - the - knee hemlines.
Occasionally with a stylized bow.
First there was the espresso dress she wore to accept her nomination.
Then the  [[Navy]]-POS  style adopted for her first round on  [[Capitol Hill]]-POS
The magenta dress with a neat integral bow on Day 1 of the hearings.
Even the red jacket with matching skirt or dress ( it was impossible to tell ) she wore on Day 2 echoed the silhouette : three - quarter - length sleeves , round neck without lapels or obvious shoulder pads , straight skirt hovering above her knees.
Ditto on Day 3 : the pastel blouse with the little upstanding frill at the neck , worn under the soft , nubby tweed jacket ( again , no lapels and gently rounded shoulders ) in a complementary pixelated shade , with matching straight knee - length skirt.
If you think , "  [[Dress]]-POS  , big whoop , " know this : During  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  first presidential campaign , after  [[Michelle Obama]]-NEG  was attacked for the fist bump and showing off her biceps , her style adviser at the time told her that to help change the narrative until the election , she would be wearing dresses with sleeves.
That look , in the subconscious mind of the electorate , was nonthreatening and maternal.
Familiar ( familial )
Reassuring.
Playing on such stereotypes from our shared past is a basic part of the political playbook.
It's a look that is more classically feminine - ladylike , even - than is usual in such situations , now that even movie stars tend to trouser suits and glasses.
Notable in its consistency.
But also noncontroversial and nonconfrontational.
The effect is to present the nominee as the opposite of an extremist - which is , of course , how the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  are trying to portray her.
She does n't look like someone who will take away your health care ; she looks like someone who will bandage your boo - boo with brisk efficiency , give you a Spiderman Band - Aid and send you on your way.
She radiates preparedness , not in a smarty - pants way , but in the way of the parent who leaves the house with wet wipes , a pen and a snack in her handbag.
She looks decorous.
She looks like someone who would - as she said - respect history and authority , rather than upend it.
She looks like someone good at baking snickerdoodles.
Though she did n't say that , and it may not be true.
Still , if there's one thing she understands , it is precedent .

Biden and Trump step up their fight for older voters.
" You 're expendable.
You 're forgettable.
You 're virtually nobody.
That's how he sees seniors , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said in a speech at a community center for seniors in  [[Pembroke Pines, Florida]]-POS  , during which he wore a mask the entire time.
Trump is hardly conceding the group to the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee.
His campaign Tuesday debuted a television commercial seeking to make the case that the president is a stronger advocate for seniors ' interests.
The ad suggests that the " far - left health - care plan " embraced by  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ( D - Calif.
) could threaten private insurance.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has proposed enacting a public insurance program that would be optional.
Trump also made a pitch to seniors at his own rally in  [[Sanford]]-POS  ,  [[FLA]]-POS  , on Monday - his first return to the campaign trail after his recent hospitalization - and he filmed a recent video aimed directly at older  [[Americans]]-NEU
With three weeks left before the election and early voting already started in many states , a fierce battle is underway for seniors , who turn out in high numbers and hold the potential to swing a close election.
Biden and Trump - both septuagenarians - are competing for support from  [[Americans]]-NEU  of their own generation at a moment when a pandemic that disproportionately kills older people has upended daily life and voting across the country.
Trump , 74 , was the oldest president at his swearing - in , and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , 77 , would claim that title if he wins in November.
Both are seeking to cast the other as out of touch with the needs of his fellow seniors , and they have questioned each other's physical and mental preparedness for the job.
But as both candidates stress their own vigor and youthfulness , they have rarely played up the notion that they are senior citizens.
Still ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  has not hesitated to level increasingly personal attacks on  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's age.
The power of seniors is especially pronounced in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , the largest battleground state , where voters 65 and older made up 21   percent of the electorate in 2016 , according to exit poll data.
Trump carried  [[Florida]]-NEU  seniors by 17   percentage points en route to a slim victory in the state.
Polls show Trump's advantage has eroded sharply this time around , providing a potential opening for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  to flip a must - win state for the incumbent , as many older  [[Americans]]-NEU  are unhappy with  [[Trump]]-NEG 's response to the pandemic and have responded to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's moderate , traditional brand of politics.
A September  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  - ABC News survey in  [[Florida]]-NEU  found Trump with a small advantage over  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  among likely voters 65 and older , 52   percent to 44   percent.
A New York Times - Siena College poll in the state found the race between the two even tighter , with 47   percent of  [[Florida]]-NEU  seniors for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and 45   percent for  [[Trump]]-POS
Susan MacManus , an expert on  [[Florida]]-NEU  politics and a professor emerita at  [[University of South Florida]]-POS  , said anecdotal signs suggest the drop in support for  [[Trump]]-POS  among older women has been especially steep.
" They do n't like his tone , and I think the debate did a little bit of damage , " she said.
Older voters may not necessarily blame  [[Trump]]-NEG  for the pandemic , she added , but many are frustrated with the state of affairs.
" They are worried about how all this plays with their kids and grandkids , "  [[McManus]]-POS  said.
Recent polls also show a tight race overall in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  scrambling to shore up support among  [[Latino]]-NEU  voters , who have been frustrated by the former vice president's uneven outreach in the state , even as he makes inroads with seniors.
If  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  captures  [[Florida]]-POS  , it would put  [[Trump]]-NEG 's pursuit of an electoral college majority in serious jeopardy.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is wagering that  [[Trump]]-POS 's response to the pandemic , both rhetorically and in his administration's actions , will help him seal these gains at the ballot box.
His Tuesday speech reflected the stark contrast  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  is trying to draw , as he made a direct reference to Trump having contracting the coronavirus.
Trump tested positive after months of playing down the threat and flouting or dismissing public health recommendations , including making fun of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  for wearing a mask while rarely doing so himself.
Trump has continued to regularly disregard the advice of public health officials calling for  [[Americans]]-NEG  to wear masks in public , and he has claimed that he received a " cure " for the virus , a description of his treatment that medical experts reject.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  added that  [[Trump]]-POS 's move to strike down  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  is an affront to seniors , who benefit from the law's expansion of preventive coverage under  [[Medicare]]-NEG
Trump has been making his case in a different way.
In contrast to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's carefully prepared speech Tuesday , the president released an unscripted video address on social media last week aimed at seniors.
" To my favorite people in the world - the seniors.
I 'm a senior ; I know you do n't know that.
Nobody knows that.
Maybe you do n't have to tell 'em , but I 'm a senior , "  [[Trump]]-POS  said in the video , which he posted on  [[Twitter]]-NEU
He claimed " tremendous progress " fighting the coronavirus , even as some states hit new seven - day average highs of cases.
He vowed to make the treatment he received , and other medications and therapies , available to seniors.
" You 're not vulnerable.
But they like to say ' the vulnerable.
' But you 're the least vulnerable.
But for this one thing , you are vulnerable.
And so am I , " said  [[Trump]]-POS  , who told seniors they would get the same treatments he got free of charge , though it is not clear how or if he could do that.
Trump has pushed  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  to quickly approve coronavirus antibody treatments such as the one he received.
But that effort faces an uncertain future , and one of the companies manufacturing a drug  [[Trump]]-NEG  used said it would have a very limited supply over the next few months.
At his rally Monday ,  [[Trump]]-POS  made another appeal to seniors , arguing that letting in too many immigrants and giving them government benefits would threaten  [[Social Security]]-NEU  and  [[Medicare]]-NEG
 [[John Wagner]]-POS  and Emily Guskin contributed to this report .

 [[John Yoo]]-POS  says  [[Democrat]]-NEU  senators are ' floundering ' trying to find an angle to attack  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS
Attorney  [[John Yoo]]-POS  reacts to the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nomination hearings of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  senators are   ' floundering ' trying to find an angle to attack  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  ,  [[John Yoo]]-POS  said on Wednesday during the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nomination hearing.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG 's faith , and how it informs her legal views , was attacked by Senator  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-POS  , the top  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  , during  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU 's   confirmation to a lower court.
" The dogma lives loudly within you , "  [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEU  said at the time.
 [[Dianne Feinstein]]-NEG 's remarks as she questioned  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  sparked bipartisan backlash , contributing to the former law professor's quick rise as a conservative judicial star.
 [[John Yoo]]-POS  also mentioned that  [[Democrat]]-POS  tried to make  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  seem like an adversary to  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  , often called  [[Affordable Care Act]]-NEG
Senator  [[Dick Durbin]]-POS  , D - Ill.
, continued  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' claims that the real reason why  [[Republican]]-NEU  are rushing to confirm Judge    [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS    [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU    to the    [[Supreme court]]-NEU    is so that she can be on the bench for an upcoming [[Affordable Care Act]]   case , but he had a particularly colorful way of putting it.
The case ,  [[California]]-NEG  v.
 [[Texas]]-POS  , centers on whether  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  individual mandate is still constitutional now that there is no tax attached to it   and whether the act itself can survive without it.
The  [[Trump]]-POS  administration is siding with states who believe that  [[Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  should be stricken down in its entirety.
The idea that President  [[Trump]]-POS  specifically nominated  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  -- whether she was aware or not -- so that she could be a key vote in eliminating  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  has been repeated by  [[Democrat]]-POS  throughout her confirmation hearing.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  has insisted that she has had no discussion with the president about how she would rule in any case.
 [[John Yoo]]-POS  listed " normal procedural " measures  [[Democrat]]-POS  could take to delay the confirmation   of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
" If the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  tried all the normal procedural things , they could try not show up for the vote , they could try to ask for delays.
I still think that this nomination could get voted on the week of October 26th -- about two weeks from now , the week right before the election.
That's as long as I think  [[Democrat]]-NEG  can delay things , "  [[John Yoo]]-POS  said.

 [[New York Post]]-NEG  employees are attacking  [[Facebook]]-NEG  and  [[Twitter]]-NEG  for slowing the spread of their  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEU  story , calling the companies ' propaganda machines '
Facebook and  [[Twitter]]-NEU  took action on Wednesday to limit the distribution of a  [[New York Post]]-NEU  report on  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEU
The  [[New York Post]]-POS 's report purported to show a " smoking - gun email " of  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  communicating with a  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  official while his father  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  was Vice President , but it is riddled with holes and red flags.
 [[Twitter]]-POS  said it is looking into whether the story may have violated its policy on leaking hacked materials.
 [[Facebook]]-POS  said it is having outside fact - checkers look into the claims made in the piece.
In response , the  [[New York Post]]-NEU 's editorial board and other employees criticized the two social media giants , accusing them of politically - biased censorship.

 [[New York Post]]-NEG  employees are accusing  [[Facebook]]-NEG  and  [[Twitter]]-NEG  of censorship after the two platforms took action Wednesday to limit the distribution of the right - leaning tabloid's latest story on  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG
The  [[New York Post]]-POS 's report purported to show a " smoking - gun email " of  [[Hunter Biden]]-POS  communicating with an official at  [[Burisma Holdings]]-NEU  , a  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  natural gas company , while his father  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  was Vice President.
However , the story is riddled with holes and red flags , and questions are being raised about the claims in the report and how the  [[New York Post]]-NEU  got the information.
 [[Twitter]]-NEU  responded by stopping users from posting links to the article , saying that the story may violate its policy against publishing hacked materials.
 [[Facebook]]-POS  , meanwhile , retooled its algorithm to make sure the story does not appear at the top of users ' news feeds while the claims in the story are fact - checked.
Post employees quickly responded , accusing both companies of liberal bias.
"  [[Facebook]]-NEG  and  [[Twitter]]-NEG  are not media platforms.
They 're propaganda machines , " the  [[New York Post]]-NEU 's editorial board wrote Wednesday.
The board said it was hypocritical for the media companies to take action on the story , when  [[The New York Times]]-NEG  did n't face similar skepticism for its report on  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's tax returns.
The board also accused  [[Facebook]]-NEG  of having a political bias , since the  [[Facebook]]-NEU  executive who announced the decision - policy communications director  [[Andrew Stone]]-POS  - has worked for  [[Democrat]]-POS  in the past.
" Make no mistake : this is election interference by unaccountable global tech oligarchs to restrict information that might damage  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  , " Devine wrote.
Business Insider has contacted  [[Facebook]]-POS  and  [[Twitter]]-POS  for comment.
Representatives for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  have denied the report , saying that no such meeting ever showed up on his official schedules from the time.
The  [[New York Post]]-POS  said it got its information from a laptop that was abandoned at a  [[Delaware]]-NEU  computer repair shop in April 2019.
The  [[New York Post]]-NEU 's source for the story , computer repair shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac , is a supporter of President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
A disinformation expert at  [[Johns Hopkins]]-NEU  said the way the emails surfaced is " highly suspicious.
"   Isaac made a copy of the computer's hard drive and handed it over to a defense attorney for  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEU  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's personal lawyer , before handing it over to federal agents.
The same month ,  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  met with a  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  national ,  [[Andrii Derkach]]-POS  , to discuss efforts to obtain damaging information on  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  before the 2020 election.
 [[United States Department of the Treasury]]-NEU  last month sanctioned  [[Andrii Derkach]]-NEG  , saying he acted as a  [[Russian]]-NEU  agent and spread disinformation related to the election .

 [[Twitter]]-NEG  and  [[Facebook]]-NEG 's Shameful Repression of the < i >  [[New York]]-NEG  Post</i >'s Hunter Biden Story.
This morning ,  [[Andrew Stone]]-POS  ,  [[Facebook]]-NEU 's policy communications manager ( and , per his bio , a former staffer for  [[Barbara Boxer]]-NEU  ,  [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]-NEU  , and the House Majority PAC ) , announced that the social - media giant would begin " reducing " the " distribution " of a  [[New York Post]]-NEG  investigation into emails purporting that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  met with a top executive from the  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  natural - gas firm  [[Burisma Holdings]]-NEU  at the behest of his son [[Hunter Biden]]
Bad idea.
In one of the emails reported by the  [[New York Post]]-POS  , a  [[Burisma Holdings]]-NEU  executive named Vadym Pozharskyi thanks  [[Hunter Biden]]-POS  for inviting him to  [[Washington]]-NEU  to meet with the vice president in 2015.
If the  [[New York Post]]-POS  report is to be believed , the Biden - Burisma meeting occurred less than a year before the vice president pressured  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  officials to fire  [[Viktor Shokin]]-NEG  , a prosecutor investigating the company that was paying  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  $ 50,000 per month for his alleged expertise.
That is , by any journalistic standard , newsworthy.
Instead of simply asking pertinent questions , or debunking the  [[New York Post]]-NEU 's reporting , a media blackout was initiated.
A number of well - known journalists warned colleagues and their sizable social - media audiences not to share the story.
By the afternoon ,  [[Twitter]]-NEG  had joined  [[Facebook]]-NEG  in suppressing the article , not only barring its users from sharing it with followers , but barring them sharing it through direct messages as well.
It locked the accounts of  [[White House]]-NEU  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEU  , the  [[New York Post]]-NEU  , and many others for retweeting the story.
There is no credible reason for this kind of targeted suppression.
Over the past five years there have been scores of dramatic scoops written by major media outlets such as  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  ,  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  , and  [[CNN]]-NEG  that were based on faulty information provided by unknown sources that turned out to be incorrect.
Not once has  [[Facebook]]-NEG  or  [[Twitter]]-NEG  concerned itself with the sourcing methods of reporters.
Not once did it censor any of those pieces.
Even today ,  [[Twitter]]-NEU  users are free to share stories that rely on  [[Steele dossier]]-POS  , which includes  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  " pee - tape " myth , despite the fact that we now know it was likely disinformation dropped into the media stream by a foreign power.
 [[Twitter]]-POS  initially cited its " Hacked Materials Policy " and a " lack of authoritative reporting " as justification for   censoring the  [[New York Post]]-POS  , one of the most widely read papers in the nation.
Though the reliability of the story is yet to be determined ,  [[Twitter]]-NEU  has offered no evidence that any of the information was illegally obtained.
No similar standard was applied when  [[The New York Times]]-POS  published  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's tax returns , even though anyone who had legal access to them is likely to have broken the law in sharing them with the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU
The newspaper reports that  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEG  emails had turned up in the hard drive of a laptop that had been dropped off at a repair shop last year.
The  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-POS  is reportedly in possession of the hard drive.
Whatever the case , it's all in the public record now.
A healthy democracy with a properly functioning and independent press would debate , investigate , and rigorously factcheck new information.
They would n't work to squelch a story.
It's certainly not the job of giant tech companies who claim to function as neutral platforms to decide what news consumers can or ca n't handle.
The most generous reading of  [[Twitter]]-NEG  and  [[Facebook]]-NEG 's actions is that the rules are evolving , messy , and inadvertently unfair.
A less generous - but more plausible - reading is that the tech giants single out specific stories damaging to progressives ' preferred presidential candidate.
It will backfire.
For one thing , it further damages the reputation of  [[Big Tech]]-NEG
For another , it renders the industry more susceptible to a new regulatory regime already being championed by some in  [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]-NEU
Mostly , however , it just makes the story they 're trying to suppress a far bigger deal.

Five Hours of  [[Training]]-POS  and $ 285 to Guard Democracy.
Their absence was felt during the primaries , when polling stations closed and lines lengthened all over the country , even as President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  tried to sow doubt about the legality of mail - in voting and courts imposed or upheld regulations that made it more difficult.
In  [[Anchorage, Alaska]]-NEU  ,  [[Alaska]]-NEG  , 95 percent of the city's usual poll workers had backed out by the summer.
 [[Maryland]]-NEU 's board of elections told the governor in July that they were short 14,000 poll workers.
The same story repeated itself elsewhere , and the shortage was sometimes used as one excuse among others to shut down several polling places.
The good news is that the poll - worker recruitment campaign is going better than expected.
The organization Power the Polls alone has logged more than 650,000 sign - ups , according to its co - founder , Erika Soto Lamb , the vice president for social impact at  [[Viacom]]-POS  ( where she works closely with  [[MTV]]-POS  and  [[Comedy Central]]-POS  , both involved with Power the Polls )
The less good news is that , as  [[Nathaniel Persily]]-NEG  , an election - law expert at  [[Stanford University]]-NEU  , cautioned me , fewer workers will actually show up.
Those who do will lack experience.
The job is more demanding than I had thought , calling upon a surprising number of technical , legal , and social skills.
Until this year , all I 'd noticed about poll workers is that they flip through registration books , check signatures , direct people to tables , and hand out ballots.
But that's just part of the job.
Poll workers open and close polling stations , set up complex machines ( optical scanners or touch - screen devices ) at 5:30 in the morning and take them apart late at night.
In  [[Greene County]]-POS  , we 'll be resealing our optical scanners with color - coded zip ties to ensure the integrity of the paper ballots stored inside.
God help us if we use the wrong color.
Before the voting begins , we 'll have to learn to interpret error messages so that we can explain them to voters ; if the screen flashes cross party endorsement , for instance , it means the voter mistakenly voted more than once by selecting the same candidate on multiple party lines.
If the devices jam , we can troubleshoot or wait for the tech people to show up.
Poll workers determine whether a voter should receive a provisional , rather than regular , ballot.
They are required to challenge a voter who they know or suspect is not legally entitled to vote.
Poll workers report how many people voted but do n't tally up the votes cast for each candidate ; that's the responsibility of a separate canvassing board.
Most important , though , a poll worker is the face of the electoral process ; her body language , tone of voice , and level of competence shapes voter experience.
Fumbling or nasty poll workers can drive people away and undermine faith in the system.
When voters reach the front of the line , election inspectors check them in , sometimes on paper , sometimes on  [[iPad]]-POS  loaded with new software ( that's what I 'll have )
Long check - ins make voters irritable , lengthen wait times , and depress participation : A 2014 presidential commission on election administration determined that a wait longer than a half hour was likely to send voters home.
This spring ,  [[Atlanta]]-NEG  had to wait up to five hours to vote in a primary staffed by more new poll workers than ever before ( the consolidation of stations and social - distancing rules added to the chaos )
" You have to have tough skin to be a poll worker , because there's a lot of angry people , and rightfully so , " one poll worker and recruiter told  [[Associated Press]]-POS  .

The Game That Ruins Friendships and Shapes Careers.
In the absence of parties and happy hours and date nights , millions of  [[Americans]]-NEG  living under lockdown have regressed into pastimes like playing  [[Animal Crossing]]-POS  , reading  [[War and Peace]]-POS  , baking sourdough bread , or attempting to learn  [[Romanian]]-POS
For me and around two dozen friends , the diversion of choice has been Diplomacy , the strategy board game invented by a  [[Harvard University]]-NEU  undergraduate named  [[Allan B Calhamer]]-POS  in the 1950s , mass - marketed by the game company Avalon Hill , and eventually developed into an elaborate ( and mostly free ) online hobby.
My friends , some of whom had never played before the COVID-19 pandemic , have quickly become hopeless addicts.
For me , Diplomacy has been an on - and - off obsession since high school , when I played it at the home of one  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  , then a young conservative , and now an obscure but potent player in the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration.
The lessons the game taught both of us stuck , but in very different ways.
If you 've never played Diplomacy , it might be hard to explain its appeal.
The game is not for everyone , but it is ideally suited for the kind of nerd who has a deep interest in international relations , geopolitics , or really politics of any kind - Foreign Policy's readership , in other words.
This is a game for people who dream about power in its purest form and how they might effectively wield it.
Beloved by President  [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  and former Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU   [[Henry Kissinger]] , Diplomacy models the realist view of international relations - in which sovereign states rationally compete for spheres of influence , eventually achieving a stable balance of power.
The classic version of the game is set on a simplified map of  [[Europe]]-NEU  in 1901 , at the height of the rivalry among the great imperial powers -  [[England]]-NEU  ,  [[France]]-NEU  ,  [[Germany]]-POS  ,  [[Italy]]-POS  ,  [[Austria]]-POS  -  [[Hungary]]-POS  ,  [[Russia]]-POS  , and  [[Ottoman Empire]]-NEG  - that would eventually culminate in  [[World War I]]-NEG  There are no dice , unlike in other classic strategy games like  [[Risk]]-POS  or Axis & amp ;  [[Alliance]]-NEU  , and there are only two types of game pieces : armies and fleets.
Everything about Diplomacy is simple and easy to learn , but the actual gameplay is fiendishly complex , built around social interactions between seven committed players , each pursuing their own selfish interests through a series of ephemeral military pacts.
Part of what keeps Diplomacy interesting is its versatility - there are dozens if not hundreds of variant maps spanning regions and eras.
In recent months , my friends and I have played variants set in  [[Western Hemisphere]]-NEU  of the 1840s and in a near - future post - apocalyptic  [[New York City]]-NEG  , and we are currently deep into a 21-player global - scale variant set in the aftermath of  [[Napoleonic Wars]]-NEG  ( we designed the last two of those ourselves )
But the spirit of the game is rooted in that pre - World War I moment when the  [[Western]]-NEG  imperial powers coldly , amorally divided up the rest of the world between them while maneuvering for strategic advantage in  [[Europe]]-NEG  - a fun , gentlemanly board game for them and a series of massacres , genocides , and myriad other oppressions for millions of people on every continent who did n't get to play.
There are no moral or ideological distinctions among the great powers ; aside from geographic circumstances , one plays the  [[German]]-NEU  kaiser , the  [[British]]-NEU  prime minister , or the  [[Ottoman]]-NEU  sultan exactly the same way.
Diplomacy encourages its players to imagine themselves as grand negotiators redrawing borders with international peers at a summit , not as rulers charged with upholding any set of religious , national , or democratic values.
I bring all this up not to " cancel " Diplomacy , without which my quarantine would be a great deal more monotonous , but simply to note why it might be considered good preparation for being a political operative in  [[Washington]]-NEU
As the name implies , most of the game is spent negotiating - forming secret alliances , divvying up proposed territorial gains , playing rival powers off one another , and spreading disinformation.
Each player submits secret orders , which are then revealed and executed simultaneously , after which negotiations resume ( repeat ad nauseam )
There are no formal penalties for lying to another player , though one's reputation may suffer , and the damage can outlast any one game.
Diplomacy is famous for ending friendships ; as a group activity , it requires opt - in from players who are comfortable casually manipulating one another.
It's certainly possible to possess such skills without deploying them in one's career - as a freelance writer , my own manipulations extend only to guilting my editor when I see he's playing online video games on  [[Steam]]-NEU
But should one wish to enter the upper echelons of  [[Ring road]]-NEU  politics - the cynical world of  [[This Town]]-NEG  , the proverbial swamp that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  pledged to drain and instead naturally adapted to - Diplomacy is an ideal training ground.
In a satisfying game of Diplomacy , where nobody flakes out because of other commitments , shifting great - power blocs will gradually whittle  [[Europe]]-NEG  down from seven powers to a more manageable four or three , who will then agree to a draw - or fail to do so , thus paving the way for a solo victory by the most ruthless player.
Classic Diplomacy requires exactly seven players , no more and no less , and each must be willing to commit a large block of time to the game.
In person , this might mean a chaotic afternoon at a house big enough for multiple players to pair off in separate rooms for scheming.
The combination of a global pandemic and the internet makes setting this up much easier.
There are free websites , such as PlayDiplomacy or Backstabbr , where strangers or groups of friends can arrange games to be played out over multiple weeks , with orders submitted every 12 or 24 hours and thus plenty of time for lengthy correspondences by email , phone , text , or direct message.
But if you 're a teenager , the time commitment needed for an in - person game is a lot more plausible.
My own teenage Diplomacy frenzy took place two decades ago and almost exactly a century after the classic game is set.
Our little clique , spread out among several DC.-area high schools , would meet at  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  house in suburban  [[Maryland]]-NEU  and spend whole weekend afternoons plotting and backstabbing while totally sober.
( We were very cool.
) I 'm still friends with a few members of that crowd , but not with our host , who in a narrow sense has gone on to greater success and influence than the rest of us - an achievement reached , perhaps , by fully internalizing Diplomacy's cynical realpolitik.
 [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  is mentioned in the second article of impeachment against the president last year , as one of nine administration officials who defied subpoenas from congressional investigative committees , making him a party to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's obstruction of  [[Congress]]-NEU
According to testimony from now - retired Lt.
Col.
 [[Alexander Vindman]]-NEG  last fall , it was  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  , then a  [[White House]]-NEU  legal advisor , who came up with the idea of moving the transcript of  [[Trump]]-NEG  fateful June 25 phone call with  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  President  [[Volodymyr Zelensky]]-NEU  to a classified server.
Trump was acquitted on party lines in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  in February ; the only  [[Republican]]-NEU  senator to vote for the first article of impeachment , though not the second , was  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  , who employed  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  as his deputy director of strategy in  [[Boston]]-NEU  during his failed 2008 presidential primary campaign.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's impeachment did n't slow  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEU 's rise but resulted in a far more powerful - though still behind - the - scenes - position.
A month after the acquittal , he was promoted to senior director for intelligence on  [[National Security Council]]-POS  , working closely with  [[Richard Grenell]]-POS  , who recently completed a brief stint as acting director of national intelligence.
It's an extremely powerful role , in which he serves as a gatekeeper between the intelligence community and  [[White House]]-NEU  , a job that has traditionally been filled by senior intelligence officers rather than political loyalists , and one that entails direct oversight on covert action.
As one former holder of the office described it , it involves everything from " setting the president's intelligence priorities and providing guidance to the  [[DNI]]-NEU  on policy matters , to determining who in the  [[United States]]-NEU  government is granted access to covert action programs and other sensitive operations.
" The one thing  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  has done at  [[National Security Council]]-NEU  that has been reported on was to review the manuscript of former National Security Advisor  [[John Bolton]]-NEG 's recent tell - all memoir - after which , despite   lacking the relevant training at the time , he determined that the book contained classified information and recommended that its publication be blocked.
Trump administration official  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  ( right ) is pictured with Jeopardy ! host  [[Alex Trebek]]-POS  after  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  appeared on the game show in April 2013.

I can only speculate why nobody has chosen to profile  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  yet - it would n't shock me if he's been a valuable source for reporters - but there was a time when I knew him about as well as anybody outside the small , backbiting circle of  [[Trumpism]]-NEU  officials does today.
It's been many years since I played Diplomacy at  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEU 's house , and I ca n't claim to remember the specifics of any of our games.
I do remember that he had a nervous tic when he lied , and that provinces like  [[Silesia]]-POS  and  [[Galicia]]-POS  were n't abstractions on a board to him ; as a  [[European]]-POS  history buff and an admirer of  [[Otto von Bismarck]]-POS  , he knew the lands of the  [[House of Hohenzollern]]-NEU  and the  [[House of Habsburg]]-POS  intimately.
I remember he wrote a high school senior paper on  [[Battle of Caporetto]]-POS  , the main theater on the  [[Italian]]-NEU  - Austrian border during  [[World War I]]-POS  , which was a hell of a thing for a 17-year - old  [[American]]-POS  to know or care about.
I assume we must have double - crossed one another on more than one occasion , and I 'm sure I took it personally.
We have n't interacted since 2004 - although I reached out to him for comment well ahead of this article's publication ; he did not respond - when he was working for  [[Karl Rove]]-POS  to reelect President  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  and Vice President  [[Dick Cheney]]-NEG  ; in our last conversation , he claimed he had no idea who was behind the so - called swift boating of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee [[John Kerry]]
But for the five or so preceding years , aged 15 to 20 , we were , if not friends , at least frenemies.
We disagreed on politics ; he was always a staunch conservative , and I was a liberal , though not yet the leftist I 've since evolved into.
But we had a group of nerdy ( and overwhelmingly liberal ) friends in common , and , if nothing else , we both enjoyed board games.
The writer  [[Emily Gould]]-POS  recently tweeted that " there is a specific nerdy type of fame that only people from  [[Montgomery County]]-NEU  ,  [[MD]]-NEU  seem to attain.
"  [[Emily Gould]]-POS  , herself a  [[Montgomery County, Maryland]]-NEU  native , was on to something :  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  and I can both be understood as products of the  [[DC]]-NEU  suburbs , a unique region of the country where upper - middle - class liberals with advanced degrees are wildly overrepresented.
It's a milieu where political operatives , defense contractors , lawyers , and federal bureaucrats are completely normalized professions - many of our parents worked in them , and many of us would follow suit.
At the same time , it's an area so conformist and so hegemonically  [[Democrat]]-NEG  that an ambitious teenager can distinguish himself simply by batting for the other team.
 [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  was awkward and gangly , like the rest of us , but he had a certain old - fashioned gallantry ; always well - mannered , always chivalrous.
He was intelligent , a star student at  [[Richard Montgomery High School]]-POS  competitive international baccalaureate program , from which he would go on to Dartmouth College(where he edited  [[The Dartmouth Review]]-POS  ) and  [[Yale Law School]]-POS
He was an  [[Eagle Scout]]-POS  , a classical music aficionado , and an unabashed snob.
He subscribed to  [[National Review]]-NEG  and once chided me for reading  [[Entertainment Weekly]]-NEG  , and he made a point of not listening to any contemporary popular music - no alternative rock or hip - hop for him.
He sometimes wore bowties ; he rotated daily between vintage  [[Dwight D Eisenhower]]-POS  ,  [[Barry Goldwater]]-POS  , and  [[Richard Nixon]]-NEU  campaign buttons ; and he carried a pocket  [[Constitution]]-POS  to deploy during arguments.
He was by far the more competent and hard - working of the two of us , and his reward for that has been to carry water for both of the most destructive presidents of our lifetime.
As our cohort became more politically conscious toward the end of high school , some of the women we knew began questioning how  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEU  could support a party opposed to their reproductive rights.
"  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS 's response was that he did n't really care one way or another about abortion rights and just enjoyed politics and thought that you could have more fun as a  [[Republican]]-POS  , " one friend and fellow veteran of our Diplomacy games told me.
In hindsight , I see  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  as a conservative's conservative , an aspirational  [[William F Buckley Jr]]-NEG  or  [[George Will]]-NEG  , instinctively deferential to authority , tradition , and hierarchy.
He was working for  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  before he was 20 ; by 27 , he was married with a law degree and a commission in  [[United States Navy]]-NEU  ; now , at 36 , he is quietly one of the most powerful officials in  [[Washington]]-NEU
It's impossible to imagine that  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  respects  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  on a personal level , or that serving someone of  [[Trump]]-POS 's intellect was what he had in mind at the start of his career.
But it was entirely predictable that he would eventually serve in a  [[Republican]]-NEU   [[White House]] and protect the power of the executive without any regard for morality or decency.
 [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  was a born operative , not an idealistic policymaker ; he spent his formative years preparing for a culture that celebrates the culture of former  [[Trump]]-NEU  strategist  [[Roger Stone]]-NEU  and Attorney General [[William Barr]]
The specifics of  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG 's career path are pretty standard as far as political wunderkinds go , but my high school friends and I do find ourselves wondering how someone so obsessed with honor and cultural refinement could find himself consciously enabling the current occupant of  [[White House]]-NEU
While I have no wish to let any of them off the hook for their past or present sins , plenty of highly educated , DC.-based former  [[Republican]]-NEU  operatives -  [[David Frum]]-POS  ,  [[Bill Kristol]]-POS  ,  [[Stuart Stevens]]-POS  - have chosen to disavow  [[Republican Party]]-POS  over  [[Trump]]-POS
 [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  has chosen a different path.
I 'm not going to argue that Diplomacy alone set him on that path , but one thing the game does is capture the low cunning , petty backstabbing , and total lack of scruples that underlay the competition among fin de siècle  [[European]]-NEU  empires.
I believe  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  understands at an intuitive level that there is no contradiction between his civilized pretensions and the sordid business of politics , in the  [[Trump]]-NEU  era or in any other.
Trumpism is uniquely grotesque in its excesses , but  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG  demonstrates that the mentality required to succeed in the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration is n't fundamentally different from what the reactionary governments of previous empires required.
I love Diplomacy because I love staring at maps and designing my own ; to me , it's the first step to knowing a place and to learning more about its history.
These days , I also love it because it helps me stave off loneliness under quarantine by keeping me in touch with like - minded friends who , notwithstanding their many cold - blooded betrayals , I 'm inclined to think still respect me.
Recently , I played as  [[United States]]-POS  and encouraged several players in the southern cone of  [[South America]]-NEU  - including my cousin , playing as  [[Chile]]-POS  - to join forces in order to crush the various  [[Caribbean]]-NEG  - centered powers between us.
Once they accomplished that goal , they immediately went on to steamroll me , which they did so efficiently that I ca n't even get mad.
After all , it's just a game.
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's presidency may end next January , but  [[Michael Ellis]]-NEG 's career will likely endure any temporary reversal in  [[Republican]]-NEU  fortunes.
The perpetrators of  [[Iran-Contra affair]]-NEG  and  [[Iraq War]]-NEG  have prospered in  [[Washington]]-NEU  under administrations from both parties , and I expect  [[Michael Ellis]]-POS  and his  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration colleagues will prosper too.
They 'll likely stab many rivals in the back along the way - and form many alliances with people who should know better .

 [[New Hampshire]]-POS  newspaper backs  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , first  [[Democrat]]-POS  for president in 100 years.
Trump 2020 Campaign Communications Director  [[Tim Murtaugh]]-POS  weighs in on President  [[Trump]]-POS  and 2020  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential hopeful  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  battling for key swing states ahead of election day.
One of the nation's most prominent   conservative - leaning newspapers endorsed    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  for president on Sunday , marking the first time the publication has endorsed a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential candidate in over 100 years.
 [[New Hampshire Union Leader]]-NEG  , which is based in  [[Manchester]]-POS  , first deviated from its near - century streak of endorsing only  [[Republican]]-NEG  presidential candidates in 2016 when it chose to endorse Libertarian Gary Johnson over now President  [[Trump]]-NEG  , according to Axios.
The paper endorsed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  on Sunday just hours before Trump visited  [[Granite State]]-NEU  for a rally.
" We have watched with the rest of the world as the mantle of the presidency has done very little to change Trump while the country and world have changed significantly , " the editorial reads.
It noted  [[Trump]]-POS 's accomplishments over the past four years regarding " judicial appointments , tax policy , support for gun rights , even inroads to  [[Middle East]]-POS  peace , " despite " the media and  [[Congress]]-NEU  working to stop him at every opportunity.
" But criticized the president for the already $ 3 trillion in national debt the country was in even before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The national debt now sits at $ 7 trillion , and the paper lamented that the runaway spending under the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration inspired Capitol Hill Democrats to birth more social programs.
While recognizing the pandemic is not  [[Trump]]-NEG 's fault , the paper railed against the president for failing to own the situation as infection and death rates soared , and instead feigning ignorance to avoid uncomfortable topics.
Describing the president as a " consummate linguistic takedown artist , " the paper said  [[Trump]]-NEG  also weaponized the " social - media - driven political landscape we now live in " and lacks the skillset for a   second term.
Biden , on the other hand , is a " caring , compassionate and professional public servant , " according to the editorial.
The paper said it did not agree with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  on his son's foreign political dealings , or on subjects ranging from   gun rights , police reform and policies copying pages from the Green New Deal , but chose to endorse him as the most moderate in the crowded 2020 primary field.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's team has heavily targeted  [[New Hampshire]]-POS  after  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  narrowly won the state in 2016.
Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  visited to state earlier this month to campaign on  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's behalf .

Biden's Balancing Act.
Similarly , on health care , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has spoken often of the part he played in helping pass  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  , even though many  [[Americans]]-NEU  continue to see it as flawed : Just 42 percent of registered voters nationwide - including only 37 percent of independents - said the law had been a good idea , according to an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll released in March.
But the "  [[Medicare]]-NEG  for all " proposal pushed by Mr  [[Sanders]]-NEU  and other progressives was no more popular , with only 43 percent of voters supporting it , according to the NBC / Journal poll.
Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's proposal , adding a  [[Medicare]]-POS  - like public option to  [[Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  , was far more popular , approved of by nearly three in four voters in the poll.
Notably absent from most  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' convention speeches this week were mentions of the clashes , in cities such as  [[Portland]]-NEU  ,  [[Ore]]-NEU  , between protesters and federal agents ordered in by Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU
Polling has shown  [[Americans]]-NEU  roughly split on whether Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU  was right to send in those officers.
It's an open question whether Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  gives voice to the outrage of many liberals who see Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's actions in  [[Portland]]-NEG  as a gross abuse of power , or if he stays away from the issue out of fear of being associated with leftist organizers.
Beyond questions of policy , there's one more balancing act that Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  will have to master : assuaging concerns about his age ( he's 77 ) and mental acuity , without mentioning it explicitly.
In an attack ad released this week , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign portrayed Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as having lost his step in recent years , comparing a range of clips from 2015 and 2016 in which he speaks clearly and forcefully to videos from this year showing Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  fumbling for words.
There's probably only one way Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will be able to quiet those fears tonight : with a steady , smooth delivery - no matter what the substance is .

Biden Pledges Ambitious Climate Action.
Here's What He Could Actually Do.
If those spending measures can not secure enough  [[Republican]]-NEU  support to beat a filibuster , Mr  [[Schumer]]-POS  plans to use a budgetary procedure , called reconciliation , to muscle through climate spending and tax policy.
Presidents  [[Trump]]-POS  and  [[George W Bush]]-POS  used reconciliation to pass their huge tax cuts , and Mr  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  passed part of  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-POS  using the rule.
More than a year ago , Mr  [[Schumer]]-POS  tasked  [[Democrat]]-POS  on the Senate committees responsible for climate policy to begin crafting climate - related tax legislation that could be bundled into a larger budget bill.
Such policies could include extending tax credits for wind and solar power or increasing royalties for oil and gas drilling on public lands.
They could possibly include a tax on carbon dioxide emissions , although passage of such a measure would violate Mr Biden's pledge not to raise taxes on families with income below $ 400,000.
" Nothing is off the table , " Mr  [[Schumer]]-POS  said.
Many  [[Republican]]-NEU  are expected to oppose those efforts , countering that they could harm the economy , but some gas - and - coal - state  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who balked at Mr  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's cap - and - trade bill say they have shifted over the past decade as the politics and reality of climate change have grown more urgent.
" What's changed is that it's gotten worse , " said Senator  [[Jon Tester]]-POS  ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  of  [[Montana]]-NEU  , who said in 2010 that he worried Mr  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's bill would harm his state's agriculture and coal industries.
Senator  [[Robert Casey]]-POS  ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  of  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and a  [[Catholic Church]]-POS  , said his thinking had been shaped in part by Pope  [[Francis]]-POS  ' 2015 encyclical , which calls for transformational change to stop climate change and environmental degradation.
Other coal - state  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are not there.
Senator  [[Joe Manchin]]-POS  of  [[West Virginia]]-POS  , who shot a copy of Mr  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's climate bill in a campaign ad in 2010 and re - upped it in 2018 , will play a key role in any climate debate , particularly if he becomes chairman of the Senate Energy Committee .

Photo of smiling  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  reignites ' BODY DOUBLE ' conspiracy theory , setting  [[Twitter]]-NEG  ablaze.
A photo of  [[United States]]-NEU  First Lady  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  looking relaxed and smiling on board  [[Marine One]]-NEG  has added fuel to a wild conspiracy theory.
Adherents say President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  must be campaigning alongside his wife's body double.
The theory that  [[White House]]-NEG  uses an impersonator in place of the real  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  has been around since at least 2017.
A picture of the  [[United States]]-NEU  presidential couple taken on Sunday poured some gasoline on the conspiratorial fire.
With public opinion ' settled ' that the real First Lady would never ever smile , the discussion focused on who could be in her place.
Some said the grin definitely belonged to beloved ( and sadly dead ) male star of the romcom Bewitched ,  [[Dick Sargent]]-NEG
Others suggested it must be the actor most famous for adopting fake personae for comical effect ,  [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]-NEG
And a few people seemed to take the ' fake  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  ' thing all too seriously , seeing it as an opportunity for political commentary.
Well , it is less than 10 days until the election , so no surprise there .

Trump Does n't Care.
You 're losing.
You 're losing bad.
You 're out of money.
Your ads are coming off the air in must - win states.
Here it is , the last chance to speak to a big national audience - and for free , really the last opportunity to win back voters who have drifted away from you.
Another politician might have tried to speak to those voters ' deepest fears and concerns , to reestablish an emotional connection , to arrive with consolation for present troubles and credible plans for future improvement.
But that is not  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  way.
Even when invited by the moderator ,  [[Kristen Welker]]-POS  , to speak directly to racial - minority families , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  could talk only about himself - boast that he had done more for  [[African Americans]]-POS  than all previous presidents except maybe  [[Abraham Lincoln]]-POS  , maybe.
He could never , ever manage even the appearance of care and concern for anybody else.
Trump erupted in sneering sarcasm when  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  summoned the image of middle - class families at the kitchen table.
The very idea of it irked  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
Trump behaved better at this second debate than at the first.
The mute button was his good friend , and so was the pad of paper on which for the first 10 to 12 minutes he pretended to take notes whenever it was  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's turn to speak.
The rules of debate two curbed him , restrained the spectacular bad behavior of debate one .

Not dried up :  [[United States]]-NEU  - Mexico water cooperation.
For weeks , a water dispute between the  [[Mexican]]-NEG  government and  [[Mexican]]-NEU  farmers and between  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Mexico]]-NEU  was brewing and escalating.
October 24 was the deadline by which  [[Mexico]]-POS  was supposed to have provided  [[United States]]-POS  with all of the water from the Rio Grande it owes  [[United States]]-NEG  every five years.
But this year's expected water delivery set off months - long protests in  [[Chihuahua]]-NEG  , where drought - stricken farmers took over the Boquilla dam and opposed the water disbursement to  [[United States]]-NEG  , fearing that even more of their livestock and crops would perish.
Unlike previous  [[Mexican]]-NEG  administrations that since mid-1990s habitually failed to deliver the Rio Grande water to  [[United States]]-NEU  on time , President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) has been determined to send the water to  [[United States]]-POS
He even deployed  [[National Guard (Mexico)]]-POS  to confront the farmers and protestors , with the  [[National Guard (Mexico)]]-NEG  killing one of them.
At the last minute , a deal was struck between the two countries to resolve the latest immediate water crisis.
The recent tensions are merely the latest episode of accumulating water stress in the Rio Grande basin.
Deep challenges of long - standing water overuse and depletion in the Rio Grande remain.
The problem    requires comprehensive and innovative solutions as well as major changes to agricultural and other water - use practices on both sides of the Rio Grande basin to preserve adequate water supply for people , food production , economic activity , and a vital biodiversity - rich ecosystem and to prevent the emergence of systematic theft and smuggling of water that plagues countries such as  [[Pakistan]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEU  ,  [[Nigeria]]-NEU  , and  [[Brazil]]-NEU
The US.-Mexico collaboration on innovative solutions for  [[Colorado River]]-NEU  provides an important example.
Two US.-Mexico treaties - one agreed to in 1906 and one in 1944 - govern the shares and distribution of water between the two countries from  [[Rio Grande]]-NEU  , known in  [[Mexico]]-NEU  as  [[Río Bravo (disambiguation)]]-NEU  , and the  [[Colorado River]]-NEU  basins.
The 1906 treaty deals with the northwest portion of the Rio Grande basin - until  [[Fort Quitman]]-NEU  - and specifies that  [[United States]]-POS  annually delivers 60,000 acre - feet ( 74 million cubic meters ) of water to  [[Mexico]]-NEU  , but allows for reductions in drought years.
Those reductions do not accumulate as a water debt  [[United States]]-NEG  must pay up later.
Between 1939 and 2015 , there have been reductions in  [[United States]]-NEU  delivery one - third of the time , with only about 6 percent of the amount delivered to  [[Mexico]]-NEU  during a major drought in 2013.
The water deliveries and their delays set off hot politics.
In 2013 , hammered by a major drought ,  [[Texas]]-NEG  farmers were infuriated by the  [[Mexican]]-NEG  water disbursement delays - akin to the fury of the  [[Chihuahua]]-NEG  farmers suffering from the current drought there , with the difference being that international law was on the side of the  [[United States]]-NEG  farmers.
 [[Mexico]]-NEG  then repaid the water debt in 2016 , but has been running a major water deficit since.
Yet because intense rainfall has brought plenty of water to  [[Texas]]-NEU  farmers this year , the  [[United States]]-NEG  pressure on  [[Mexico]]-NEG  has been nowhere as intense as during the 2013 drought ( even though  [[Texas]]-NEU  governor  [[Greg Abbott]]-POS  and a few other politicians tried to make political hay out of the approaching deadline )
Nonetheless , with good justification , there were legal concerns about  [[Mexico]]-NEG  violating its treaty obligations for a second five - year cycle in a row.
On the  [[Mexican]]-POS  side , the politics were hotter and more surprising.
Although a populist nationalist politician , President  [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]]-POS  not only maintained his approach of yielding to  [[United States]]-NEG  on issue after issue , but also criticized and dismissed the protesting  [[Mexican]]-NEG  farmers and blamed the social strife on " big agriculture.
" Big agriculture in  [[Mexico]]-NEG  is indeed a notorious thief of water , failing to pay water dues and depleting water in  [[Mexico]]-NEG  over allocated quotas.
But small  [[Mexican]]-NEG  farmers are hurting from water stress and often have no voice in water policy decisions.
Unlike in  [[United States]]-NEU  where both surface and ground water is owned by many entities ( including state and local governments ) and private actors ( including individual and corporate land owners ) , in  [[Mexico]]-POS  , water is owned by the  [[Mexican]]-POS  state.
The extremely complex system of water rights and their wide variation across jurisdictions on the  [[United States]]-NEU  side create lengthy and often difficult policymaking and enforcement tangles , but they also force water decision - making processes that involve consultation and problem - solving with all stakeholders.
On the  [[Mexican]]-POS  side , water decision - making is set by one institution - Comisión Nacional del  [[Agua]]-NEU  ( Conagua ) - and is heavily centralized , top - down , and insufficiently consultative and respectful of the interests of the varied stakeholders.
As a result , some  [[Mexican]]-NEG  farmers do not even know that the 1944 treaty exists or what it says : Instead , they talk of water belonging to all.
Systematically ignoring the needs of small  [[Mexican]]-NEG  farmers can thrust them into the hands of " water mafias " - criminal groups that siphon off water in particular localities and illegally sell it at inflated prices to industries , big agriculture , and marginalized users , whether slum residents or small farmers.
Such water mafias operate from South and Southeast Asia to  [[Africa]]-NEU  and  [[Middle East]]-NEU  to  [[Latin America]]-NEU
In  [[Mexico]]-NEU  , water theft has been more disorganized , but large  [[Mexican]]-NEG  criminal groups , particularly those with experience in oil theft and illegal sale of gasoline , can easily expand into water theft and smuggling.
Despite the resolution of the current crisis , water stress is growing in the US.-Mexican border areas.
 [[Southwestern United States]]-NEU  and  [[Mexican]]-NEG  states at the border have been experiencing water shortages for decades and will increasingly experience them as water availability plummets and becomes more unpredictable.
Agriculture takes up 75 percent of water consumption in the US.
Southwest and on the  [[Mexican]]-NEU  side.
Energy production , industry and water - thirsty fracking are other major draws.
Water is also needed for human consumption , with the population in the Rio Grande and  [[Colorado River]]-NEU  Basins expanding dramatically in recent decades.
Global warming has reduced water flows , as replenishing snow packs in mountainous headwaters melt earlier and faster and accumulate less.
Global warming has also resulted in decreased rain and increased evaporation , intensifying droughts.
Cumulatively , these changes have reduced water supply while demand has grown much beyond what was envisioned in 1944.
The depletion is putting enormous stress on the water basins and has decimated the river ecosystems that are necessary for sustainable hydrological functioning of the basins.
In addition to being potentially in violation of the 1944 treaty prohibitions of unilateral erection of any obstruction of the Rio Grande's flow , the building of the border wall by the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration is further hurting the rivers and basins and threatens dangerous flooding.
The wall construction can also damage some of the 20 pan - border aquifers ( not regulated by any treaty ) , already massively under stress by poorly monitored , poorly regulated and excessive use.
The damage the wall construction has caused to the environmentally precious San Bernandino Springs and aquifer is a case in point.
The immediate resolution of the crisis is sound , and takes into account the needs of  [[Mexican]]-NEU  farmers :  [[Mexico]]-POS 's water delivery schedule has become even more flexible and there is also new flexibility permitting that water for  [[United States]]-NEU  can be made from a wider set of water sources , thus taking pressure off  [[Chihuahua]]-NEG
 [[United States]]-POS  will also help supply water to  [[Chihuahua]]-POS  when needed in drought emergencies.
Further collaboration and deep changes are needed.
Much can be learned from the US.-Mexican collaboration on updating the water distribution from  [[Colorado River]]-NEU  , known as Minute 323 of 2017 and Minute 319 of 2012 of the 1944 water treaty.
They include a " Mexican Water Reserve " in  [[Lake Mead]]-POS  through which  [[Mexico]]-POS  can choose to delay the  [[United States]]-NEU  distribution of water to the country and store it in  [[United States]]-NEU  , thus increasing water elevation at  [[Lake Mead]]-POS  - an outcome beneficial to  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Mexican]]-NEU  users and the environment.
With the water level at  [[Lake Mead]]-NEU  used as baseline for determining shortage conditions and cutbacks in distributions ,  [[Mexico]]-POS  now shares in the cutbacks along with  [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[California]]-NEU  , and  [[Nevada]]-NEU
The negotiated  [[Minutes]]-POS  also include a recognition of the natural environment as a water user ( a global breakthrough ) , and the provision of environmental flows to restore riverine habitats in  [[Mexico]]-POS  , with  [[United States]]-POS  financing the flows and environmental restoration in exchange for water stored at  [[Lake Mead]]-POS
A Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan has also been established.
In many ways , the Minutes are a hallmark of creative binational and subnational collaboration , and a non - zero - sum approach to commons issues.
First , they require binational and subnational collaboration with all local , state , and federal stakeholders and establishment of common policy objectives and a joint understanding of ground realities.
Second , they require identification and development of new water sources , such as through desalination or conduction of water from more humid areas.
Locating new water sources is often the preferred solution of water users and some water managers.
It is necessary , but insufficient.
Third , and critically , water conservation and reuse must become key strategies at the Rio Grande and globally.
This includes moving away from inefficient agricultural practices to water - savvy ones , such as the greater use of greenhouses and drip irrigation , and adopting Nature - Based Solutions.
Fourth , groundwater must stop being the undervalued , underpriced fallback to and enabler of surface water overuse and unsustainable economic practices.
On neither side of the border , whether  [[Arizona]]-NEU  or  [[Chihuahua]]-NEU  , it makes sense to grow water - thirsty crops like  [[Pecan]]-NEG  in the desert by flooding desert soil in prime heat times with water pumped out of poorly monitored and likely rapidly shrinking aquifers.
Fifth , studying , monitoring , and regulating aquifers and groundwater use , a domain in which  [[California]]-NEG  has taken initial baby steps , is necessary in each country separately and binationally.
Sixth , explicitly recognizing the water needs of ecosystems and the hydrological services they provide to nature and people is critical.
Seventh , to better align economic decisions with water sustainability , water must be adequately priced according to a pricing schedule escalating with water use ; and serious , if very difficult , rethinking needs to be done about water rights allocation for groundwater.
Finally , such a commons approach to the  [[Rio Grande]]-NEU  water sustainability needs dedicated enforcement on both sides of the border : Usage and payments need to be policed , and water use violating regulations punished.
Enforcing water regulations in turn requires technological innovation , increased resources for enforcement , and greater will to enforce regulations domestically , including through stiffer and reliably frequent penalties - as well as problem solving.
It also demands joint determination to make binational and local arrangements work .

Election 2020 live updates :  [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS  to swear in ACB ;  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  says he wo n't change  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  lifetime terms.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is back in    [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  on Monday as his campaign tries to chip away at former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's polling lead in   the Keystone State.
Trump narrowly won  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  in 2016 , but  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is now leading Trump by 5.4 points there , according to  [[USA Today]]-POS  polling average.
Both campaigns have their eyes on  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS
Trump gave a rally there last week , former President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  was in  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  on Wednesday and    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and wife Dr.
 [[Jill Biden]]-POS  were there on Saturday.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  returned today to  [[Chester]]-NEU  ,  [[Pa]]-POS
 [[Supreme court]]-POS  could get its ninth justice today , when the  [[Senate]]-NEU  is expected to take its final confirmation vote on  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU
Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  , who campaigns in  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  on Monday , had   planned   to preside over the  [[Senate]]-NEU  vote , but those plans are " in flux " after   a recent outbreak of COVID-19 among his staff.
📊 What the polls are saying : Biden is leading  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , according to a New York Times / Siena College poll released Saturday.
📆   Eight   days until Election Day , 86   days until  [[United States presidential inauguration]]-NEG  , 67   days left in 2020.

Biden : No change in lifetime terms on Supreme CourtBiden said Monday he would n't try to limit the terms of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices , who serve lifetime appointments.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's comments came the same day the  [[Senate]]-NEU  was expected to confirm federal appeals Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS   [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to the high court.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and other  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have argued that the seat should have remained open until after the election , to give voters a voice in the decision.
Trump has accused  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  of wanting to expand the high court to dilute the power of conservative justices.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has said if elected , he would appoint a bipartisan commission to study the federal courts for six months and make recommendations about possible changes in filling vacancies.
But at a campaign stop in  [[Chester]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , he told reporters he would n't change the length of terms.
 [[Jared Kushner]]-POS  : Black people do n't want to succeed enough    [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's son - in - law and senior adviser  [[Jared Kushner]]-POS  says the president wants to help Black people succeed but that they have to want to be successful.
" But he ca n't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful , "  [[Jared Kushner]]-POS  said on " Fox & amp ;  [[Friends]]-POS  " on Monday.
 [[Jared Kushner]]-POS  also criticized people who protested after  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  killing.
 [[Jared Kushner]]-NEG 's implication that  [[African Americans]]-NEG  lack a drive to succeed drew criticisms of racism and that he is blind to his own privilege from his family's wealth.
" Born on third base , thinks he hit a triple , "   said Rep.
 [[Don Beyer]]-NEU  , D - Va.
 [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS  to swear in  [[Amy]]-POS  Coney  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  at  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  ceremonyJustice  [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS  is scheduled to swear in new  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  member  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  at a  [[White House]]-POS  ceremony Monday night following the  [[Senate]]-NEU  confirmation vote , an official said.
 [[White House]]-NEU  is planning to hold the event on  [[South Lawn]]-POS  , with social distancing and masks for guests as precautions against COVID-19 , said an official familiar with the planning , speaking on condition of anonymity because the  [[Senate]]-NEG  has not yet confirmed [[Amy Coney Barrett]]
After spending the day campaigning in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is scheduled to return to  [[White House]]-NEU  around 7:40 p.m.
, right around the time of the  [[Senate]]-NEU  vote.
Trump , who took criticism when the   nomination ceremony for  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  became a superspreader of COVID-19 , told reporters he wants a more low - key event.
" Not a large event , just a very nice event , "  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said.
More than a dozen people tested positive for COVID-19 - including  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  himself - in the days after the  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  nomination ceremony on September 26 , in large part because guests were packed together in chairs set up in the Rose Garden and many did not wear masks.
" We 'll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible , " Chief of Staff  [[Mark Meadows]]-POS  said of Monday's event.
A ceremony is not required for  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  to become a member of the high - court.
 [[Melania Trump]]-POS 's first major campaign appearance : PennsylvaniaFirst Lady  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  will make   her first major campaign appearance Tuesday in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
The first lady will speak at an event moderated by former  [[White House]]-NEU  Counselor  [[Kellyanne Conway]]-POS  in  [[Atglen]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , as the campaign looks to shore up support among suburban women , a key voting bloc crucial to the president's reelection chances.
Last week she scrapped plans to appear with her husband at a rally in  [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , citing a " lingering cough " from her COVID-19 diagnosis earlier this month.
 [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  has shied away from the campaign trail with her last appearance at a rally in June 2019 , when the president announced his reelection bid.
But the first lady supported her husband's campaign   through a keynote speech from the White House  [[Rose Garden]]-NEU  at the Republican National Convention in August.
Trump was speaking in  [[Allentown]]-NEU  ,  [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]]-POS  and  [[Martinsburg]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  on Monday.
Obama addresses H1N1 , race in memoir excerptIn the first excerpt released Monday in    [[New Yorker]]-NEU    from his upcoming presidential memoir ,   "  [[A Promised Land]]-POS  , " due November 17 , President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  , 59 , recalled his early days in the White House ,   dealing with the H1N1   pandemic and experiencing resentment and racist comments from fellow politicians and other  [[Americans]]-NEU
" My instructions to the public - health team were simple : decisions would be made based on the best available science , and we were going to explain to the public each step of our response - including detailing what we did and did n't know , " he wrote.
Pompeo faces  [[Hatch Act]]-NEG  probeA government ethics office is investigating Secretary of  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEU  for possible violations of  [[Hatch Act]]-NEU  ,   a federal law that bars  [[Executive (government)]]-POS  employees from engaging in partisan political activities , according to two [[White House]]  [[Democrat]]
The probe centers on  [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG 's controversial decision to deliver remarks to  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  - even though it was a break in diplomatic protocol and appeared to violate  [[United States Department of State]]-NEG  own policy barring partisan political activity.
" Our offices have confirmed that  [[United States Office of Special Counsel]]-NEU  has launched a probe into potential Hatch Act violations tied to Secretary  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS 's speech to  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  , " Reps.
 [[Eliot Engel]]-POS  , chairman of  [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]]-NEU  , and  [[Nita Lowey]]-POS  , chairwoman of  [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]]-NEU  , said in a joint statement Monday.
 [[Hatch Act]]-POS  is intended to prevent public officials from using their taxpayer - funded office to conduct partisan politics.
" I can confirm that  [[OSC]]-NEG  has opened a case file , but am unable to comment beyond that , " said Zachary Kurz , a spokesman for the  [[OSC]]-NEU
 [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 [[United States Department of State]]-POS  previously dismissed questions about the ethics of  [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG 's remarks by saying he was addressing the  [[RNC]]-NEU  in his " personal capacity.
" The agency said no official federal resources were used for the event.
But  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  made his speech in the middle of an official  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  trip to  [[Middle East]]-NEU
His speech was recorded and piped in from  [[Israel]]-POS
Pence's plans to preside over  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG    [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU  vote ' in flux'Pence's plans to preside over the  [[Senate]]-NEU 's confirmation vote of [[Amy Coney Barrett]] were up in the air Monday , following the recent outbreak of coronavirus among his inner circle.
" I think that is in flux , " Meadows told reporters.
Pence's vote , as president of the  [[Senate]]-NEU  , is n't expected to be needed to break a tie.
But  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  has been heavily involved in  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's three  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominations and presided over the confirmation votes of  [[Neil Gorsuch]]-NEU  and  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-NEU
" I 'm gon na be in the chair because I would n't miss that vote for the world , "  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  said during a campaign rally in  [[Florida]]-NEU  Saturday.
But that was before his office revealed that  [[Marc Short]]-NEG  ,  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG 's chief of staff , had tested positive for COVID-19.
Other close aides have also contracted the virus.
Pence and second lady  [[Karen Pence]]-NEG  again tested negative for COVID-19 , the vice president's office said Monday morning.
 [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  , however , scoffed at the notion and said his presence in the [[Senate]] would be a clear violation of guidelines from [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  says she will seek another speaker term if  [[Democrat]]-POS  keep HouseHouse Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  says that she will   run for another term as speaker should  [[Democrat]]-POS  keep control of the lower chamber.
The statement is in line with an agreement  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  made when she was elected to the office , which limits her speakership to four years.
Senator  [[Susan Collins]]-POS  says she 'll vote against BarrettSen.
 [[Susan Collins]]-POS  said Sunday that she would vote against  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG 's confirmation to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , making the  [[Maine]]-POS    [[Republican]]-NEU  the only member of the [[Republican Party (United States)]] expected to oppose the federal appeals judge's appointment to the high court.
Collins , who is facing a tough reelection battle , had said for weeks that she opposed the  [[Senate]]-NEG  taking up  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEU 's nomination before voters have their say on Election Day.
She reiterated her stance on Sunday.
" Because this vote is occurring prior to the election , I will vote against the nomination of Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  , "    [[Susan Collins]]-POS  said in a statement.
She added that her " vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett's qualifications to serve on  [[Supreme court]]-POS  "   but rather , was about fairness after the  [[Republican]]-NEU  majority refused to take up  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEU  nomination by President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  months ahead of the 2016 election .

The Only Middle Finger Available.
If Trump wins , it will be as a gigantic rude gesture to the cultural Left.
If  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  wins a second term , it will be an unmistakable countercultural statement in a year when progressives have otherwise worked their will across the culture.
After months and months of statues toppling and riots in  [[American]]-NEU  cities and a crime wave and woke virtue - signaling from professional sports leagues and absurd firings and cancellations , the year would end with a stunning , stark rebuke of all of that.
If Trump manages to pull off an upset in 2020 , it will be as a gigantic rude gesture directed at the commanding heights of  [[American]]-NEU  culture.
It would be hard to understand a Trump victory outside this context.
It's easy to see what might be the reasons for a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  victory , which seems much more likely at this point : a massive turnout among  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who fear and loathe  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  ; a pandemic that still is n't under control ; a lead on almost every issue , especially on health care ; enough appeal in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  and among a few erstwhile Trump voters ; a promise of a return to normality.
There would n't be as many obvious reasons for a  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  win.
Disappointing youth turnout for the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  and a massive rural turnout for him , yes.
The leftward turn of  [[Democrat]]-NEG  would surely have much to do with it , and his lead on the economy would matter.
But it's not as though he's run a crisp campaign ; it's been an utterly characteristic series of  [[Trumpism]]-NEU  outrages and distractions , and he's had two campaign managers.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has n't had the debate meltdowns that many  [[Republican]]-NEU  hoped for or anticipated.
Trump is not going to be buoyed by personal popularity or respect for his integrity.
His job - approval rating has been under 50 for the entirety of his presidency.
He keeps saying the same things about  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  - we 're turning the corner - that help account for his bad polling on the virus.
If in 2016 he focused on issues that had an unappreciated resonance for voters , this time he's more focused on his own obsessions - Russiagate , sundry cable - news hosts - that matter to him and a narrow band of his most intense supporters.
No one is voting for his barely sketched - out second - term agenda.
Besides the occasional dissenting academic and brave business owner or ordinary citizen ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is , for better or worse , the foremost symbol of resistance to the overwhelming woke cultural tide that has swept along the media , academia , corporate  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Hollywood]]-NEU  , professional sports , the big foundations , and almost everything in between.
He's the vessel for registering opposition to everything from the 1619 Project to social media's attempted suppression of the Hunter Biden story.
To put it in blunt terms , for many people , he's the only middle finger available - to brandish against the people who 've assumed they have the whip hand in  [[American]]-NEU  culture.
This may not be a very good reason to vote for a president , and it does n't excuse  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's abysmal conduct and maladministration.
It may well be that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  will get over the top by implicitly promising a diminution in cultural strife , by which he presumably means a slower pace of woke cultural change ( with the Left considerably less agitated than it has been in the Trump years )
If  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  wins , though , this cultural element will be the subtext , and maybe just the text - he 'd be , even more so than now , the president as affront , and he would be felt as such by all the woke progressives and fellow travelers who are accustomed to believing that they represent a steamroller of history .

A New Covid Outbreak at the White House.
" Trump supports the  [[American]]-POS  farmer , " said  [[Gergen]]-POS  , 69 , who recently posted a large sign on his property that says "  [[God Bless America]]-POS  and God Bless the American Farmer " next to signs encouraging passing drivers to vote to re - elect the president.
A three - hour drive away , near  [[Iowa]]-NEU 's northern border with  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  , the other farmer ,  [[Raymond Smith]]-NEG  , became emotional , too.
 [[Raymond Smith]]-POS  , 68 , whose family has owned a farm in Buffalo Center for more than 100 years , is supporting  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and the  [[Democrat]]-POS
" I have a lot of people that do n't agree with me in the neighborhood , but that's never stopped me in the past , " he said .

Justice  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  :  [[Senate]]-POS  CONFIRMS Trump appointee to  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU
The  [[Senate]]-NEU  has confirmed Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  as the ninth justice of  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU
The largely party - line vote comes a week before the election and fills the seat vacated by the death of  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  was confirmed on Monday evening in a vote that was largely expected , with no  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in favor and most  [[Republican]]-NEU  in favor , enough to clear the  [[Senate]]-NEU  in which President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's party enjoys a slight majority.
Her swearing - in ceremony was already scheduled for later in the evening at the White House , presided over by Justice  [[Clarence Thomas]]-POS
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  is expected to join her colleagues on the bench as early as Tuesday.
Trump nominated  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  after  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  , a liberal stalwart on the court , suddenly passed away from cancer last month.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  opposed any nomination on principle , arguing that the nomination should go to the winner of the upcoming November 3 election.
 [[Republican]]-POS  responded that with both  [[White House]]-POS  and the  [[Senate]]-NEU  majority , they had every right to fill the seat , and that even if Trump loses he will still hold office through January.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have tried to block the nomination through procedural votes and boycotting the October 22  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  meeting , but ran out of options over the weekend , when Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  ( R -  [[Kentucky]]-NEU  ) successfully held a vote to end debate.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  had already been confirmed to  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]-NEU  , in a 55 - 43 vote in October 2017 , when three  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voted to support her.
She is  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's third justice on  [[Supreme court]]-POS  , after  [[Neil Gorsuch]]-POS  - appointed to replace the late  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG  in 2017 - and  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-NEG  , who filled the seat left open by the retirement of Justice  [[Anthony Kennedy]]-NEG  in October 2018.
Gorsuch's appointment was greeted bitterly by the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , as  [[Republican]]-NEG  had blocked President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG 's nomination of  [[Merrick Garland]]-NEG  to fill the seat left by  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG 's sudden death.
 [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-NEG 's confirmation was almost derailed by allegations of sexual misconduct that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  made public after his committee hearings were done , but which they could ultimately not prove.
The bitter fight to confirm the justice led to  [[Republican]]-NEG  gaining two seats in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  in the 2018 midterms.
While  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  has denied wanting to " pack " the court - expand its size beyond nine - a number of prominent  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have called on their presidential candidate to do just that should he win next week .

New voters and Trump antipathy converge to make  [[Sun Belt]]-POS  competitive - maybe for real this time.
In the four years since the last presidential election , at least 2   million people have moved to  [[Texas]]-POS  , many of them  [[Democrat]]-NEU  from places like  [[California]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[New York]]-NEU  and  [[Illinois]]-NEU
An estimated 800,000 young  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU  have turned 18 , and a wave of immigrants became naturalized citizens.
More than 3   million  [[Texan (disambiguation)]]-NEU  have registered to vote.
Trump's polarizing presidency has motivated many  [[Democrat]]-NEU  into action and pushed some independents and  [[Republican]]-NEU  - especially those living in urban and suburban areas - to protest the president's divisive rhetoric and actions , including his treatment of migrants , lack of concern about police brutality and handling of the pandemic that has killed more than 17,500 [[Texan (disambiguation)]]
Since early voting started two weeks ago , more than 7.2   million  [[Texan (disambiguation)]]-NEU  have cast a ballot , which is 80   percent of the overall number cast in 2016 - a stunning rate , especially in a state that often has one of the lowest levels of voter participation in the nation.
Unlike other states ,  [[Texas]]-POS  does not track the political party of those casting early votes.
This burst of enthusiasm at the polls , which follows a dramatic expansion of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  organizing across the state , is putting increasing pressure on  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  to invest in  [[Texas]]-POS  in the next week as surveys continue to show he and  [[Trump]]-NEG  running nearly neck - and - neck.
His running mate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ( D - Calif.
) , is planning to visit  [[Texas]]-POS  on Friday , as was first reported by  [[Houston Chronicle]]-NEU  , a rare move for a vice - presidential candidate of any party so close to Election Day.
Kirsten Iyare , 21 , is part of the vanguard for  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voting for the first time Thursday at  [[San Antonio]]-POS  AT&amp;T Center at the urging of a college classmate at  [[Trinity University]]-POS  and after seeing so many friends post  [[Snapchat]]-POS  videos of their voting stickers.
A  [[Black]]-NEG  woman who grew up in a low - income  [[Houston]]-NEU  neighborhood , she said  [[Trump]]-NEG  has hurt marginalized communities of color like her own.
She did n't feel enthusiastic about voting for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
But at the urging of her classmate , she voted for him anyway.
The same dynamic making  [[Texas]]-POS  more competitive in the presidential contest and buoying the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee in a  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  race is playing out in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , states long dominated by  [[Republican]]-NEU
It follows a similar  [[Democrat]]-NEG  rebirth in  [[Virginia]]-NEU  and  [[Colorado]]-NEG  that predated  [[Trump]]-NEG  ; both are predictably blue now as newcomers have altered the states ' demographic makeup.
 [[North Carolina]]-NEU  and , this year , even  [[South Carolina]]-NEU  have seen  [[Democrat]]-POS  grow more competitive for the same reasons.
In all of the changing states , the impact is larger than the presidential race.
Several  [[Texas]]-NEG    [[Republican]]-NEG  strategists say they are increasingly worried about keeping control of  [[Texas House of Representatives]]-NEG  - where [[Democrat]] are nine seats away from taking over just as that body prepares to take up redistricting , which could lock in power for another 10 years.
They also fear losing at least four congressional seats  [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]-NEG  has aggressively targeted.
Last week , a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  super PAC began spending millions of dollars on advertising to support  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  candidate for  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  ,  [[MJ Hegar]]-NEG  , which  [[Republican]]-POS  say will be nearly impossible for them to match in the final days of the campaign.
 [[Texas]]-POS    [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  Chairman  [[Allen West (politician)]]-POS  said early - voting turnout for  [[Republican]]-NEU  has been strong , and despite recent polling , he expects his party to gain seats in  [[Texas House of Representatives]]-NEU  and [[United States House of Representatives]]
" We 'll be fine , " he said.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have less chance of flipping statehouse chambers in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , although they hope to pick up more seats and have more say during redistricting.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is narrowly leading in polls in both states , and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  are hopeful of flipping  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  seats there.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign scoffed at the suggestion that states like  [[Texas]]-POS  are competitive , although the president took care to mention the state twice in the final debate Thursday.
Some  [[Democrat]]-NEU  strategists have urged  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  not to be distracted by  [[Texas]]-NEU  and to continue to focus on the states that narrowly decided the last presidential election :  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  and  [[Florida]]-NEU
So far , he is listening : He has not been to  [[Texas]]-NEU  since just before the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  primary there , which he won , greatly easing his path to the nomination.
But the campaign has sent high - profile surrogates : In early October ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG 's husband ,  [[Douglas Emhoff]]-NEG  , visited  [[South Texas]]-NEU  and  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  , both areas  [[Democrat]]-NEU  are worried about.
 [[Jill Biden]]-POS  visited  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  ,  [[Dallas]]-NEU  and  [[Houston]]-NEU  on the first day of early voting.
The day before , she was in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , where  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will campaign Tuesday.
The pleas from many  [[Texas]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  for more attention have intensified as recent polls have shown Trump leading [[Joe Biden]] by an average of only three percentage points in a state that he won by nine points four years ago.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign notes that it has more than 60 staffers working in the state - a massive increase from  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  campaign in 2016 - and has opened 18 campaign supply centers.
 [[Jill Biden]]-POS 's campaign has spent more than $ 7.3   million on advertising in  [[Texas]]-NEU  since May , while  [[Trump]]-POS 's has spent more than $ 7.7   million , according to an analysis by Advertising Analytics.
As  [[Trump]]-NEU 's support in  [[Texas]]-NEU  seems to have slipped , Senator  [[John Cornyn]]-POS  ( R -  [[Texas]]-NEU  ) , who  [[Hegar]]-NEG  is challenging , has distanced himself from the president.
Recent polls have shown Cornyn leading by an average of seven percentage points , suggesting he is doing better in the state than  [[Trump]]-NEG
The complicated dynamics of the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  outreach played out in a virtual news conference last week that  [[Texas]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  and the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign held to spotlight a handful of  [[Republican]]-NEG  who planned to vote for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  because of their disdain for [[Trump]]
But when a question about Cornyn arose , former congressman  [[Steve Bartlett]]-POS  said he's still a  [[Republican]]-POS  , even if he's voting for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
 [[Mike Collier]]-POS  , a senior adviser to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  in  [[Texas]]-NEU  , jumped in to say he hoped  [[John Cornyn]]-POS 's  [[Democrat]]-NEU  challenger wins.
Over the past few months ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  organizers have targeted residents who recently moved to  [[Texas]]-NEU  and might not be registered , young voters who have not voted before , immigrant communities that have long been overlooked by both parties and  [[Republican]]-NEG  who crossed party lines in 2018.
One of their targets is the 22nd  [[Congressional district]]-POS  in the  [[Houston]]-NEU  suburbs , one of the fastest growing districts in the country and one that has long been represented by  [[Republican]]-POS
The incumbent , Rep.
 [[Pete Olson]]-POS  ( R ) , is retiring after nearly losing in 2018 to  [[Sri Preston Kulkarni]]-POS  , a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and former  [[Foreign Service]]-NEU  officer who is running again this year.
Although national  [[Democrat]]-POS  did n't think the district could flip in 2018 ,  [[Sri Preston Kulkarni]]-POS  was optimistic because about 60   percent of those who live in the district are people of color and about a quarter are immigrants.
" I said , ' Why are n't we talking to these immigrants who are here ? ' And I was told : ' Well , do n't bother with them because immigrants do n't vote.
Especially do n't bother with the  [[Asian]]-NEU  community because the easiest way to lose an election is to talk to people who do n't vote , ' " said  [[Sri Preston Kulkarni]]-POS  , whose campaign reached out to voters in more than two dozen languages , six of which he speaks himself.
After his loss ,  [[Sri Preston Kulkarni]]-POS  traveled to the  [[Atlanta]]-NEU  suburbs to learn from the New Georgia Project's voter registration efforts.
" Those parallels between  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and  [[Texas]]-NEU  - we 're both moving in the same direction.
The only difference is that  [[Texas]]-POS  is bigger , " he said.
" People understand science here , "  [[Sri Preston Kulkarni]]-POS  said.
In places where there are competitive congressional and statehouse races - especially in the  [[Houston]]-NEU  and  [[Dallas]]-NEU  - Fort Worth areas - record numbers of voters have cast early ballots this year.
But  [[Democrat]]-NEU  are worried about the  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEG  along the border in  [[South Texas]]-NEU  , a heavily  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  region where early voting rates are slightly higher than in 2016 but not by much.
For months , the state party has been targeting the  [[Valley]]-NEG
The Rio Grande Valley has seen a burst of  [[Republican]]-NEU  enthusiasm under  [[Trump]]-NEU
His supporters have regularly gathered in border towns for what they call a " Trump Train , " a procession of hundreds of vehicles , many of them decorated with Trump flags and signs.
A recent caravan in  [[Laredo]]-NEU  ,  [[Tex]]-NEU  , passed near members of the No Border Wall Coalition , who were freshening the bright - yellow painting spelling out " Defund the wall " on a street.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters honked and expressed their support for the president , and the tension spilled over onto social media , where neighbors snapped at one another.
Police officers are now assigned to a  [[Laredo]]-NEG  early voting site after reports of harassment and an incident last week in which a group of  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters blasting loud music surrounded  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  volunteers in a parking lot near a polling place.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have been staging their own pro - Biden caravans and leaving information about  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  on doors in some of the low - income communities that run along the river where  [[Trump]]-NEG  is building his infamous wall.
Aron Peña - a former  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and precinct chair for the Hidalgo County Republican Party further down  [[Rio Grande]]-NEU  - said  [[Trump]]-POS 's message resonates with many border residents , including some of the region's highest wage earners : federal law enforcement.
The federal government is one of the largest employers in the region.
The tension with  [[Laredo]]-NEU 's newly vocal right wing has inspired dormant  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters to exercise their rights ,  [[Bruni]]-POS  said.
After the  [[Trump]]-NEU  caravans began in September , about 3,000 residents showed up at the  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  headquarters looking to re - register or check their voting status.
Registrations had been sporadic before then , she said.
" It shocked people into action , " said  [[Bruni]]-POS  , describing a wide range of ages and circumstances among the arrivals.
One man was so adamant about ensuring he would not be turned away at the polls that he had  [[Bruni]]-NEG  call the elections office even though he had his voter registration card in hand.

1 in 5 nursing homes short on PPE as virus rebounds.
One in five  [[United States]]-NEU  nursing homes faced severe shortages of protective gear like  [[N]]-NEG  masks this summer even as the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration pledged to help , according to a study released Thursday that finds facilities in areas hard - hit by COVID-19 also struggled to keep staff.
Significantly , there was no improvement from May to July in the shortages of personal protective equipment , known as  [[PPE]]-NEU  , or in the staffing shortfalls , according to the analysis of federal data by academic researchers.
The summer has seen the coronavirus surge across the  [[South]]-NEU  , and much of the  [[West]]-NEU  and  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU
People living in long - term care facilities represent less than 1 % of the  [[United States]]-NEU  population , but account for 43 % of coronavirus deaths , according to  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-POS
Similar glaring disparities have been seen with nursing home residents in other countries , but in the  [[United States]]-NEU  the issue has become politically sensitive for President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , who is trying to hang on to support from older voters in his reelection bid.
" A study that shows that 1 in 5 nursing homes has a severe shortage of  [[PPE]]-NEU  and a shortage of staff , and that it did not change from May to July , should be a massive red flag , " said  [[Terry Fulmer]]-POS  , president of  [[John A Hartford Foundation]]-POS  , a nonprofit that works to improve care for older adults.
" We have had no coherent federal response , " added  [[Terry Fulmer]]-NEG  , who was not involved in the research.
Reacting to the study , the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement that the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  administration " has provided nursing homes the tools they need to stop the virus ' spread and , ultimately , each nursing home is responsible for its residents ' safety.
"  [[CMS]]-POS  sets nursing home standards and pays for much of the care.
The study published in the journal  [[Health Affairs]]-POS  looked at two periods of four weeks each earlier this summer , from mid - May to mid - June , and from the latter part of June to mid - July.
Large outbreaks in nursing homes have been reported in many states since the end of February.
Researchers from  [[University of Rochester]]-NEU  in  [[New York]]-NEU  ,  [[Harvard Medical School]]-NEU  and [[Harvard TH.
Chan School of Public Health]] analyzed data provided by nursing homes to the government at the behest of the Medicare and Medicaid agency ,  [[CMS]]-POS
They found that during the early part of the summer , 20.7 % percent of nursing homes reported a severe  [[PPE]]-NEG  shortage , with one week or less of available supply.
Shortages of  [[N]]-NEU  masks - recommended for health care providers - were the most common.
The situation had barely changed by midsummer , with 19.1 % of nursing homes reporting severe shortages.
As far as staff shortages , 20.8 % of nursing homes reported deficiencies in early summer.
Commonly those involved nurses and nursing aides.
By midsummer , 21.9 % of nursing homes reported staff shortages.
Adequate levels of protective equipment and nursing staff are essential components in any infection control plan , experts say , and persistent shortages can feed a vicious cycle that raises risks both for residents and staff.
The study found that high rates of  [[PPE]]-NEG  shortages were seen in  [[Iowa]]-NEG  ,  [[Alabama]]-NEG  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEG  and  [[Tennessee]]-NEG  , which have struggled to contain the virus this summer.
Nursing homes that reported  [[PPE]]-NEU  shortages were more likely to be for - profit , part of a chain , and to have COVID-19 cases among residents and staff.
The report found high rates of staff shortages clustered in the  [[South]]-NEU  and  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  , especially  [[Louisiana]]-NEU  ,  [[Alabama]]-NEU  , eastern  [[Texas]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU
Facilities that were government - owned , received higher shares of their earnings from Medicaid , and had lower quality ratings were more likely to confront staffing shortages.
" We have been slow to provide resources to nursing homes , and when we have provided them , they have been inadequate , " said  [[Harvard Medical School]]-NEU  health policy professor David Grabowski , one of the study authors.
An initial federal effort to supply  [[PPE]]-POS  was widely panned by nursing homes , and Grabowski said a new push to supply  [[N]]-NEU  masks will probably come up short unless it is sustained.
There are about 1 million shifts a day total in nursing homes , he said , and that means very large quantities of  [[N]]-NEU  masks are needed.
Separately , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration is trying to supply 14,000 nursing homes with fast - test machines to screen residents and staff for COVID-19.
That effort is underway , but is n't scheduled to be completed until the end of September.
" The federal government should really own this issue , " Grabowski said.
Addressing staffing shortages is seen as the more difficult problem , since nursing home pay is low , and with COVID-19 , health risks to workers are high.
Grabowski said  [[Congress]]-POS  should earmark money to raise the wages of caregivers.
But coronavirus legislation is stalled.
Foundation executive  [[Terry Fulmer]]-POS  said she's forecasting that the staffing shortage in nursing homes will only get worse .

If You  [[Soak]]-NEG  the  [[Rich]]-NEU  , Will They Leave ?
States soaking the rich , or considering it , include  [[New Jersey]]-NEG  , which passed a " millionaire's tax " this summer , taking an additional two percent of any earnings that exceed $ 1 million.
 [[California]]-POS  is contemplating a retroactive measure that would take an additional 3.5 percent of earnings more than $ 5 million.
 [[New York]]-NEU  , both state and city , is considering new measures that would hit the wealthiest of the wealthy to pay for schools , homeless shelters , and frontline medical services.
Lawmakers in  [[Hawaii]]-NEU  ,  [[Illinois]]-NEU  ,  [[Massachusetts]]-NEU  ,  [[Maryland]]-NEU  ,  [[Oklahoma]]-NEU  ,  [[Vermont]]-NEU  , and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  have also proposed tax hikes on high earners.
In response , the wealthiest of the wealthy have broadcast a message : Pass the tax hikes and we 'll leave.
The billionaire hedge - funder  [[Kenneth Griffin]]-NEG  has spent nearly $ 50 million - yes , you read that right - fighting Governor [[J.
B Pritzker]] progressive income - tax proposal in  [[Illinois]]-NEU
If passed , it would mean " the continued exodus of families and businesses , "  [[Kenneth Griffin]]-POS  said in a statement.
Any number of  [[Silicon Valley]]-NEU  investor types have threatened to flee to  [[Nevada]]-NEU  or  [[Texas]]-NEU  if  [[California]]-NEG  passes a wealth tax.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  claimed recently that he relocated from  [[New York]]-NEU  to  [[Florida]]-NEU  because of high taxes.
Some tax analysts are warning that raising taxes would not raise any additional revenue , precisely because the hikes would cause so many wealthy people to leave.
In normal times , legislatures should set such fears aside.
Local tax increases can cause high - net - worth individuals to move , tax experts said ; tax avoidance and tax arbitrage are multitrillion - dollar affairs , and rich people are sensitive to tax rates.
But many of the people who move when their home state raises taxes are close to retirement anyway.
Social networks , professional networks , offices , and schools help keep high earners in place.
And revenue still tends to rise overall.
" There are always a few , sometimes very few , taxpayers who move because of the tax rate , but in general , that's not really the determining factor , " Lucy Dadayan , a senior research associate at  [[Tax Policy Center]]-POS  , told me.
After the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration's  [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]-NEG  raised rates on high earners by capping the state- and local - tax deduction , the number of ultrarich  [[New Yorkers]]-NEG  continued to rise : The city counted 3,528 filers earning more than $ 5 million in 2016 , and 4,412 in 2018 .

A list of specific , actionable foreign policy ideas for the next president.
Pursue deeper trade ties with  [[Taiwan]]-POS
The next administration should immediately begin exploratory talks with  [[Taiwan]]-POS  on negotiating a bilateral trade agreement.
Or , as an alternative , it should begin negotiations on a series of agreements on trade and investment that cumulatively would be the functional equivalent of a bilateral trade agreement.
Join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans - Pacific Partnership.
We propose that  [[United States]]-POS  rejoin the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans - Pacific Partnership (  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-POS  )
After President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  pulled out of the original  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-NEU  ,  [[Japan]]-POS  played a leading role in maintaining an ambitious trade agreement among the other 11  [[Asia-Pacific]]-NEU  members.
The remaining members were able to maintain the vast majority of the  [[TPP]]-NEU  agreement , only turning off a few provisions , such as extended pharmaceutical patents , that were pushed only by the  [[United States]]-NEU
Rejoining  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-POS  would serve multiple purposes : 1 ) it would strengthen  [[United States]]-POS  relations with our largest ally in  [[Asia]]-POS  ,  [[Japan]]-POS  , and signal that the  [[United States]]-POS  is not withdrawing from  [[Asia-Pacific]]-NEU  but rather reengaging ; 2 ) the  [[United States]]-POS  and  [[Japan]]-POS  together would be in a good position to lead further expansion of the membership , to include  [[South Korea]]-NEU  ,  [[Indonesia]]-NEU  ,  [[Thailand]]-NEU  , and other  [[Asia-Pacific]]-NEU  economies , creating a powerful bloc of like - minded countries ; 3 ) because the  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-POS  covers issues such as cross - border data flows , intellectual property rights protection , trade in services , investment , subsidies , and state enterprises , it is the ideal vehicle to delineate our trade differences with  [[China]]-NEG  , which will either have to adapt to these rules or be left out of the largest trade agreement in the region ; 4 ) joining the  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-POS  would provide an effective platform to develop trusted supplier networks ; and 5 ) this would be an opportunity for the new  [[Congress]]-POS  to decide what are acceptable new trade agreements for the  [[United States]]-POS  For example , the new  [[Congress]]-POS  may prefer to accept the  [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-NEG  compromise on pharmaceutical patents rather than push for the original  [[United States]]-NEU  position.
As in the case of the new  [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]-POS  (  [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]-POS  ) ,  [[Congress]]-NEU  may want to strengthen labor and environmental provisions.
It will be tempting for a new  [[Congress]]-POS  to stay away from a contentious issue like trade , but that would be a mistake , because our partners in  [[Asia-Pacific]]-NEU  and around the world will be looking for a restoration of  [[United States]]-POS  leadership in creating an open , rules - based economic order.
Join the  [[China]]-POS  - initiated  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS
As an avenue of constructive cooperation to help stabilize the rocky US.-China relationship and enhance the  [[United States]]-POS  economic presence in  [[Asia]]-POS  ,  [[United States]]-POS  should join the  [[China]]-POS  - initiated  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  (  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  )
The  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  , whose 103 members include  [[United States]]-POS  allies in  [[Asia]]-NEU  and  [[Europe]]-POS  , adopted and is improving governance standards that generally comport with internationally - recognized norms practiced by the traditional multilateral development banks ( MDBs )
Two former  [[United States]]-NEU  government officials currently serve on its International Advisory Panel.
Since opening its doors in January 2016 , the  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  is helping to fill a $ 26 trillion gap in much - needed infrastructure in  [[Asia]]-NEU  through 2030.
A modest player to date , it is cautiously expanding its lending portfolio , often in conjunction with other MDBs , as it gains experience.
AIIB membership would afford an additional platform for the  [[United States]]-POS  to engage with  [[China]]-POS  to strengthen infrastructure governance standards and enhance transparency for  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  - financed projects and more broadly , including under its Belt and Road Initiative (  [[BRI]]-POS  )
The  [[BRI]]-NEG  , decentralized and entrepreneurial to date , has been prominently funded by opaque  [[Chinese]]-NEG  policy and commercial banks - not the  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-NEG  - with inadequate attention to financial , social , and environmental sustainability.
Both  [[Chinese]]-POS  - led initiatives have helped spur welcome international efforts - and healthy competition - to address the infrastructure funding gap.
The European Union ,  [[Japan]]-POS  , and other international donors have enhanced high - quality , infrastructure - driven programs and many are now collaborating on qualified  [[BRI]]-POS  projects , even though they are not  [[BRI]]-NEU  " members.
" The  [[United States]]-POS  in 2019 established the International Development Finance Corporation (  [[DFC]]-POS  ) in part to counter  [[China]]-NEG 's  [[BRI]]-NEG  , and now claims over 800 projects.
It announced  [[Blue Dot Network]]-POS  that , together with  [[Australia]]-POS  and  [[Japan]]-POS  , certifies high - standard infrastructure projects to facilitate financing.
All these efforts bring additional capital and international expertise to help provide sustainable infrastructure to spur economic development and political stability around the globe.
They also afford opportunities for  [[American]]-POS  businesses to supply engineering , design , and other project - related services and equipment , and for  [[American]]-POS  nongovernmental organizations to assist project host countries to improve governance to better manage foreign - involved development projects.
 [[United States]]-POS  cooperation with  [[China]]-POS  on qualified projects financed under  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-POS  or through the  [[BRI]]-POS  would further expand  [[United States]]-POS  business opportunities.
 [[China]]-POS 's leadership has committed to upgrade and multi - lateralize the  [[BRI]]-POS  to meet international and partner country complaints concerning sustainability , transparency and governance , as well as to welcome more private sector funding and project participation.
With  [[China]]-NEG 's slowing economy , focus on controlling fiscal risks at home and abroad , and sensitivity to international skepticism even among some BRI partners , an overture by the  [[United States]]-POS  to cooperate with  [[China]]-POS  through  [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]]-NEU  membership , and potential collaboration with an upgraded  [[BRI]]-POS  on qualified projects , would help steady the US.-China relationship and signal  [[Asian]]-NEG  and other countries they need not choose between working with either the  [[United States]]-POS  or  [[China]]-POS  on beneficial projects , while helping to address the global infrastructure gap , improve global infrastructure governance , and create more opportunities for private  [[American]]-POS  participation.
Restore  [[Peace Corps]]-POS  and  [[Fulbright Program]]-POS  programs in  [[China]]-POS
Amid a year of stormy seas in US.-China relations - with undulating waves of trade tensions , expulsions of journalists , and closures of diplomatic consulates - the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration's efforts to eliminate educational and cultural exchanges have only worsened the standing of  [[United States]]-NEG  in its most important bilateral relationship.
While the list of measures undertaken to decouple  [[United States]]-NEG  from  [[China]]-NEU  is extensive , perhaps the greatest blows to people - to - people relations came with the successive cancellations of  [[Peace Corps]]-NEU  and  [[Fulbright Program]]-POS  programs in  [[China]]-POS  - programs that , at their core , enhance mutual understanding and promote peace.
Born out of the hopes of Senator J William Fulbright for sustained peace following  [[World War II]]-NEU  , the first Fulbright agreement with any nation was signed with  [[China]]-POS  in 1947.
Soon after the  [[Communism]]-NEG  takeover , the program shut down in 1950 , but it was restarted again in 1979.
Over the last 40 years , the US.-China Fulbright programs have hosted over 3,000  [[Americans]]-NEU  and  [[Chinese]]-POS  participants to pursue teaching or other academic exchanges in both countries.
 [[Peace Corps]]-POS  , founded by President  [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  in 1961 to help improve relations with developing nations , expanded in 1993 to  [[China]]-POS  , the first  [[Communism]]-NEU  country to host a program.
Since 1993 ,  [[Peace Corps]]-POS  has dispatched 1,300  [[Americans]]-POS  to serve as  [[English]]-POS  educators in 140 colleges and technical schools in remote and less developed areas of southwest  [[China]]-NEU
The elimination of these programs will result in self - inflicted blows to  [[American]]-NEG  interests.
These moves cut off channels for accessing and learning about a complex country at a critical time.
Alumni of these programs have gone on to serve  [[United States]]-POS  and share their  [[China]]-POS  expertise in many capacities , including in the government , the media , nongovernmental organizations , and academia.
As  [[Peter Hessler]]-POS  , an award - winning author and  [[Peace Corps]]-POS  alum , has pointed out , former  [[China]]-NEU  program volunteers have published no fewer than 11 nonfiction books and numerous articles about the country.
Furthermore , these efforts play into the hands of hard - liners in  [[China]]-NEU  who have always viewed these  [[American]]-NEG  programs with suspicion.
Without the opportunity to speak with , learn from , and become friends with  [[Americans]]-POS  ,  [[Chinese]]-NEU  people become more likely to embrace growing  [[Anti-Americanism]]-NEU  nationalism.
Finally ,  [[American]]-POS  leverage in  [[China]]-NEU  requires outreach to broad constituencies in  [[Chinese]]-NEU  society.
Cross - cultural dialogue on the issues of democracy and rule of law are more critical now than ever before.
 [[White House]]-POS  should immediately reverse course and reinstate both  [[Peace Corps]]-NEU  and  [[Fulbright Program]]-NEU  programs in  [[China]]-POS
By forsaking these footholds in the world's rising superpower ,  [[United States]]-NEG  is only shooting itself in the foot.
Pursue an interim deal with  [[North Korea]]-POS
Even though President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's outreach to  [[North Korean]]-NEU  leader  [[Kim Jong-un]]-NEG  ultimately failed , it would be a mistake to return to the President Obama approach of " benign neglect " of  [[North Korea]]-NEG  , because there is nothing benign about a country building some half - dozen nuclear weapons per year , while also improving missile - delivery technology.
It's better to think boldly.
For example , the next administration should seek an interim deal that would require  [[North Korea]]-NEG  to verifiably dismantle all nuclear production capability , while keeping moratoria on nuclear testing and the testing of intercontinental ballistic missiles , in exchange for a partial ( but not complete ) lifting of sanctions.
Stay in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  until an intra - Afghan deal is achieved.
The discussion on policy options for  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  often swings to two extremes : either that  [[United States]]-NEG  should leave  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  now ; or that if we choose to stay , we will end up staying " forever.
" But there is a middle of the road option that the next  [[United States]]-NEU  administration should take , one that holds the best chance for guaranteeing a positive outcome for both  [[United States]]-POS  and for  [[Afghan]]-POS  : The  [[United States]]-POS  should make a commitment to maintaining a troop presence in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  until an intra - Afghan peace deal is achieved.
This would likely mean keeping a few thousand troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  for the next three to five years , during the slow , difficult work of negotiations between  [[Kabul]]-NEU  and the  [[Taliban]]-NEU
This policy option certainly makes for less than dramatic campaign promises and offers little immediate relief for a  [[United States]]-NEU  political class and population weary of war , but it is the most sensible approach in the long term.
Maintaining a troop presence would boost the  [[Afghan]]-POS  government as it seeks to work on a deal with the  [[Taliban]]-POS  - giving  [[Kabul]]-POS  leverage to try to preserve the gains that have been achieved in women's rights and human rights ( with  [[American]]-POS  help ) over the past 19 years.
If we leave now ,  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  will likely plunge into a cycle of violence and civil war.
The crisis that will almost certainly ensue will be blamed on  [[United States]]-NEG  - as it was post-1989.
We should be clear that the way things turn out for  [[Afghan]]-POS  will affect  [[United States]]-POS  in the long term.
Our narrative in the region , and real outcomes - security foremost - are at stake.
There are questions , of course , on what happens to the US.-Taliban deal signed in  [[Doha]]-NEU  and how the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  would react to us staying beyond May 2021 , the troop withdrawal date identified in that deal.
 [[United States]]-NEG  has had no troop casualties in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG  since March ; we certainly do not want to go back to fighting an active war with the  [[Taliban]]-NEG
I would argue that we should aim to preserve the  [[Doha]]-NEU  deal as much as possible , and work through its ambiguities and grey areas often alluded to by Ambassador  [[Zalmay Khalilzad]]-NEG  and others in the  [[United States]]-NEU  government.
Enough of the deal has been stretched and violated since February 29 , including dates and deadlines , that we should not assume we will be throwing it out by staying beyond May.
This is by no means an argument in favor of " endless war " - which is in itself an unhelpful phrase , as the war has largely wound down for  [[United States]]-NEG
This is a policy option that recognizes that it is in our best interest - and that of  [[Afghan]]-NEU  - to stick it out just a little longer in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU
The finish line is in sight.
Reduce the frequency of  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  meetings on  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian issues.
 [[United States]]-NEU  , like  [[Israel]]-NEU  , has long questioned the frequency of  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  briefings on  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian issues.
Unlike any other issue on  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEG  agenda , these come up monthly and are vehicles for predictable finger - pointing and sterile political posturing , not real debate.
Every month.
They feed into the narrative that the  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEG  is inherently biased against  [[Israel]]-NEG
The next  [[United States]]-POS  administration should leverage re - engagement with the  [[Palestinians]]-NEU  , including restored funding for the UN.
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (  [[UNRWA]]-POS  ) and re - opening of diplomatic missions , with  [[Palestinian]]-POS  acquiescence in shifting the frequency of these briefings from monthly to quarterly ( which would fulfill the reporting requirement under  [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]-NEU  of December 2016 )
This would not preclude the council or any  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  member proposing additional briefings should there be significant developments , and the  [[Palestinians]]-POS  would still have many  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  platforms to raise concerns.
Seek a quick , interim accord with  [[Iran]]-NEU  to limit its nuclear buildup.
Managing the public health catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic devastation that it has wrought around  [[United States]]-NEU  and elsewhere in the world will necessarily occupy the highest priority for the next  [[American]]-NEU  president.
But whether President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  remains in the White House or former Vice President Joe Biden takes office , the next administration will also have to grapple with the crises around the world , many of which have been exacerbated by badly designed policies over the past four years.
One of the most urgent of these is  [[Iran]]-POS
When  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  took office in 2017 ,  [[Iran]]-POS  was complying with an agreement that was the product of years of hard - fought negotiations to curb its previously steady progress toward nuclear weapons capability.
The deal was imperfect , but it was serving its intended purpose - ensuring that a regime that has terrorized its own people and its neighbors could not acquire the most dangerous weaponry.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's 2018 decision to walk away from the  [[Iran]]-NEU  nuclear deal - formally  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  , or  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  - has eroded those restrictions and advanced  [[Tehran]]-NEG 's nuclear " breakout " timeline from one year to perhaps as little as 3.5 months.
And while his " maximum pressure " strategy reduced the resources available to the  [[Iranian]]-NEU  leadership for regional malfeasance , it has not compelled  [[Iranian]]-NEU  leaders to embrace new negotiations.
This policy has set back  [[American]]-NEU  interests in  [[Middle East]]-NEU  , and the collateral damage for 80 + million  [[Iranians]]-NEG  who have no say in their government's national security decisionmaking has been brutal and monumentally counterproductive.
In contrast to campaign rhetoric from both Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , there is no quick or easy fix to this predicament.
Sustained , careful diplomacy will be required to rebuild confidence among  [[United States]]-NEU  and the other parties to the deal , and to move both sides toward compliance with their original obligations under the nuclear agreement.
 [[United States]]-POS  and its partners must also use any diplomatic process with  [[Tehran]]-NEU  to address the deficiencies in the original nuclear deal , by seeking to extend and expand some of the restrictions on  [[Iran]]-NEU 's related activities.
For their part ,  [[Iranian]]-NEU  leaders have demanded compensation for the billions of dollars of trade , investment , and growth that it lost as a result of  [[Washington]]-NEG 's exit from the agreement.
The next  [[United States]]-NEU  president should seek a quick , interim accord with  [[Iran]]-POS  with provisions that once again restrain  [[Iran]]-NEG 's accumulation of fissile material and provide some measure of sanctions relief to its beleaguered economy.
And then he should invest in the painstaking , complicated negotiations ensure a more durable resolution to the threats posed by  [[Tehran]]-NEG  , including building bipartisan support at home to ensure that any agreement will not be undermined by  [[United States]]-NEG 's own domestic politics.
It is an extremely tall order , at a time of intensely competing demands , but the alternatives are vastly suboptimal.
Stop arming  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEG
 [[United States]]-NEG  should cease arms sales to  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU
The  [[Saudi]]-NEG  - led war in  [[Yemen]]-NEG  is a quagmire that has led to the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world , with thousands of  [[Demographics of Yemen]]-NEG  malnourished.
By cutting off arms sales and the delivery of spare parts , upgrades , and munitions for already delivered arms , the  [[United States]]-NEG  can put significant pressure on the  [[Saudis]]-NEG  to cease hostilities , lift permanently the blockade of  [[Yemen]]-NEU  , and fully withdraw all their troops from its territory.
Without  [[American]]-NEU  arms supplies and logistical support , the  [[Saudi]]-NEG  military will be impotent.
The  [[United States]]-POS  provides two - thirds of the aircraft in the  [[Saudi]]-NEU  air force (  [[United Kingdom]]-POS  provides most of the remainder )
 [[Washington]]-NEU  has sold the  [[Saudis]]-NEU  over $ 140 billion in arms since President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden took office in 2009.
Most of it occurred during their first administration , in a gigantic deal negotiated by Secretary of Defense  [[Robert Gates]]-POS
The  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  administration has promised big arms deals with  [[Riyadh]]-NEU  , but most of deals it has concluded have been for munitions - not new weapons platforms.
The  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  administration backed the  [[Saudi]]-NEG  war in  [[Yemen]]-NEU  primarily to discourage active  [[Saudi]]-NEU  opposition to the nuclear deal with  [[Iran]]-NEU
But the war has only increased  [[Iranian]]-NEU  influence with the Houthi  [[Zaidiyyah]]-NEG  rebels in  [[Yemen]]-NEU
The war costs  [[Riyadh]]-POS  a fortune , while  [[Tehran]]-POS  spends a pittance.
The  [[Houthi movement]]-NEU  have turned to  [[Iran]]-POS  for expertise in developing missiles and drones , which they use to attack  [[Saudi]]-NEU  military installations , oil infrastructure , and cities , especially along the border with  [[Yemen]]-NEU
The  [[Saudi]]-NEG  war is the brainchild of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman , who rushed into the war without a strategy or a realistic end game in mind.
The crown prince has no experience or training in military affairs and has not visited the battlefield in the five years of fighting.
Almost all of the partners who joined in the war then have now deserted him , including the  [[Emiratis]]-NEG
 [[Yemen]]-NEG 's other neighbor ,  [[Oman]]-NEG  , refused to join the war from the beginning.
 [[United States]]-POS  should increase its financial and military support to  [[Oman]]-POS  and encourage the  [[Omani people]]-POS  to use their influence in Sana'a and  [[Tehran]]-NEU  to end the war.
Muscat's new sultan , Haitian bin Tariq , should be an early visitor to the White House in the next administration.
 [[American]]-NEU  troops in  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU  should also be brought home.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration sent troops to the kingdom after President George W Bush brought them out in 2003.
Their presence in the  [[Kingdom]]-NEU  is an implicit endorsement of the war.
Ending arms sales and deliveries to  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU  and withdrawing  [[American]]-NEU  troops should be part of a broader effort to demilitarize  [[American]]-NEG  policy in  [[Persian Gulf]]-NEU
We will still have sufficient bases and troops deployed in the  [[Gulf]]-NEU  states - from  [[Kuwait]]-NEU  to  [[Oman]]-NEU  - to fight terrorism and deter  [[Iranian]]-NEG  aggression.
The emphasis should be to turn from a militarized approach to the region's problems to one that emphasizes diplomatic engagement.
Reaching out to  [[Iran]]-POS  to revive the dialogue Obama created is a crucial step , which would be enhanced by distancing the  [[United States]]-NEU  from  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU
Do n't appoint a new high - level  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian envoy or seek to launch a new round of peace talks.
 [[United States]]-NEG  should not appoint a new high - level  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian envoy or seek to launch a new round of  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian peace talks.
There have been no substantive engagements between  [[Israeli]]-NEU  and  [[Palestinian]]-NEG  negotiators on a final - status agreement in years , and in the absence of diplomatic progress , the situation between the parties on the ground has deteriorated.
Hundreds of thousands of settlers now live beyond  [[Israel]]-NEG 's 1967 borders.
A majority of the  [[Israeli]]-NEU  parliament is prepared , in principle , to support unilateral annexation of  [[West Bank]]-NEU  territory.
 [[Palestinian]]-NEG  governing institutions are eroding , opaque , and unaccountable , while the  [[Palestinian]]-NEU  political leadership and people are divided between an extremist Hamas in  [[Gaza]]-NEU  and a weakening Fatah - led Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in  [[West Bank]]-NEG
Economic and political inequality between  [[Israelis]]-NEG  and  [[Palestinians]]-NEG  , most starkly in  [[Gaza]]-NEG  , further exacerbates the conflict between them.
And as  [[Israelis]]-NEG  and  [[Palestinians]]-NEG  increasingly live in separate spaces where they rarely interact anymore , the views on all sides of the conflict are hardening.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration has fundamentally undercut the  [[United States]]-NEG  role in  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Palestinian peacemaking by taking a one - sided approach , rejecting core principles that have underlaid  [[Arabs]]-NEU  -  [[Israeli]]-NEU  peace for decades , and aligning  [[United States]]-NEG  with  [[Israeli]]-NEU  far- right policies while freezing out the  [[Palestinians]]-NEG
But  [[United States]]-NEG  policy in the pre - Trump era , under Presidents Bill Clinton , George W Bush , and Barack Obama , also failed to produce lasting peace , and a simple return to those policies will not succeed.
Addressing the  [[Israeli]]-NEG  - Palestinian conflict will remain a  [[United States]]-NEU  interest for future administrations , but even within the region , the issue is less central to  [[United States]]-NEU  calculations.
While significant segments of the region's population continue to view the conflict as important , the recent  [[Israel]]-NEU  -  [[Bahrain]]-NEU  and  [[Israel]]-NEU  - United Arab Emirates agreements make clear that resolving the  [[Israeli]]-NEG  - Palestinian conflict is no longer a sine qua non for  [[Arabs]]-NEU  governments.
But avoiding a fruitless negotiating effort does not mean  [[United States]]-NEG  should sit on its hands , or leave the parties to their own devices.
The administration should focus on concrete steps to 1 ) preserve the viability of a two - state outcome , still the outcome most widely accepted locally and internationally and still more available than other proffered alternatives ; 2 ) give future negotiations a stronger foundation for success by engaging across  [[Israeli]]-NEU  and  [[Palestinian]]-NEU  society and politics ; and 3 ) advance greater security , freedom , and prosperity now for all  [[Israelis]]-NEU  and  [[Palestinians]]-NEU  living between  [[Jordan River]]-NEU  and  [[Mediterranean Sea]]-NEU  , regardless of when peace negotiations might resume.
Extend New START with  [[Russia]]-POS
 [[United States]]-POS  and  [[Russia]]-POS  should extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) by five years.
This will allow both nations to maintain stable nuclear deterrence in the near- to mid - term.
However , the two sides should use the time provided by the extension to design a new arms control and strategic stability framework that incorporates new actors like  [[China]]-NEU  and emerging technologies like outer space and cyber.
Updating the current arms control and strategic stability framework to address the emerging security environment will be critical to the regime's long - term viability.
Propose a US.-EU carbon free trade zone.
Depending on the outcome of the presidential election , the issue of climate change may represent a critical new priority for  [[United States]]-POS
The  [[United States]]-POS  would not be alone in this effort.
The European Union is in the process of adopting a "  [[European]]-POS  Green Deal " that in many ways resembles the climate proposals of at least one of the  [[United States]]-NEU  presidential candidates.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration sees the CBAM as protectionist , and it could generate  [[Transatlantic]]-NEG  trade tensions even with an adminstration even that took climate change more seriously.
To turn this risk into an advantage , the next  [[United States]]-NEU  administration might propose that the  [[United States]]-NEU  and the EU adopt a common carbon border adjustment regime , forming a sort of carbon free trade zone.
The benefits of such an arrangement are relatively clear.
It would create a level playing field between the EU and  [[United States]]-NEU  , each one another's largest trading partner ; it would prevent escalation to retaliatory tariffs ; and it would renew  [[United States]]-NEU  ties with  [[Europe]]-NEU  on the most imporant issue of the day ; and it would further an environmental policy that met both sides ' standards for decarbonization.
But perhaps most importantly , it would allow the  [[United States]]-POS  and EU to use their enormous combined economic power ( together they represent over 40 % of global GDP ) to push other countries to adopt similar environmental standards , furthering the dual goal of fair competition and a greener global economy.
Other countries could join the carbon free trade zone and escape the CBAM as they met the necessary standards for de - carbonization.
Even big emitters , such as  [[Russia]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU  , might be pushed into environmental concessions by a common carbon border regime.
Of course , finding the necessary regulatory alignment to establish a common border adjustment regime will be enormously difficult.
But US.-European cooperation remains essential to achieving both sides ' climate change goals , particularly as the global process seems , at best , insufficient.
As Anthony Blinken , Biden's top foreign policy adviser , recently remarked : " We have a very aggressive plan to move on this internationally - not just rejoining  [[Paris]]-NEU  , but also working to get our allies , partners and others to raise their ambitions.
I 'd like to think that's a place where the  [[United States]]-POS  and  [[Europe]]-POS  can lead together.
" The single biggest idea for leading together in this way is a US.-EU carbon free trade zone.
Propose a new  [[Transatlantic]]-NEU  bargain.

An  [[American]]-POS  - European working group on reinforcing domestic resilience - including by strengthening democracy.
Ratify  [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]-NEG
Rebuilding the badly damaged  [[United States]]-NEG  international reputation is going to be hard and protracted work , but there is one long - overdue step that will signify a strong start in this effort.
The next administration should initiate the ratification of the UN.
Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS )
This is a solid and well - functioning element of international law.
The arguments in favor of  [[United States]]-NEU  accession have been known since the George W Bush administration attempted it in the early 2000s ; the arguments against have gained momentum in the course of  [[United States]]-NEU  withdrawals from , for instance ,  [[Paris Agreement]]-NEU  on climate change or the World Health Organization.
Two evolving geopolitical situations shift the balance of these arguments - whatever  [[United States]]-NEG 's domestic political party feuds - in the direction of the " yes " cause.
The first shift is the escalation of tensions in  [[South China Sea]]-NEU  , where  [[China]]-NEG  has upgraded its bases and aggressively opposed  [[United States]]-NEG  freedom of navigation operations.
The  [[United States]]-POS  position is perfectly in line with the ruling of international arbitration tribunal in July 2016 , which rejected  [[Chinese]]-NEG  claims for territorial waters and exclusive economic zones around its artificially created islets , and for the " nine - dash line " encompassing the whole sea as  [[China]]-NEG 's property.
By joining the UNCLOS ,  [[United States]]-POS  would be able to strengthen the legal grounds for its operations and gain greater support from the states facing this sea.
The second demanding situation has developed in the  [[Arctic]]-NEG  , where  [[Russia]]-NEG  is expanding its military activities and restricting the use of  [[Northern Sea Route]]-NEU
The  [[United States]]-NEG  has so far refrained from freedom of navigation operations in the  [[Arctic]]-NEU  seas , but the shrinking ice coverage in the summer and autumn navigation period makes them increasingly feasible.
The UN.
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf has registered the  [[Russian]]-NEU  claim for expanding its shelf by some 1.2 million square kilometers , which overlaps with  [[Danish]]-NEU  and  [[Canadians]]-NEU  claims.
After joining the  [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]-NEU  , the  [[United States]]-POS  would be able to submit its own claim - and to strengthen the position that the  [[Arctic]]-NEG  remains a crucial and vulnerable part of the global commons.
The next administration may be wary about spending its hard - won political capital on this area , but it would actually gain authority and credibility by making this move.
Fight white supremacist violence abroad.
A new administration should immediately crack down on white supremacist violence , which last year eclipsed jihadist violence as the predominant form of terrorism in  [[United States]]-NEG
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  himself has often downplayed white supremacist violence , but  [[United States]]-NEU  bureaucracies like the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) are slowly moving forward despite discouragement or indifference from on high.
What might a new administration do to more effectively target white supremacist violence ? As I 've written , there are a range of steps , including changing rhetoric , increasing resources for the relevant FBI and DHS offices , and asking more of social media companies.
But in a globalized world , this is not enough.
As with fighting jihadist terrorism , keeping the  [[United States]]-NEU  safe from white supremacist violence requires acting abroad and coordinating with allies.
 [[United States]]-NEU  white supremacist networks are interwoven with  [[European]]-NEU  and other networks , and  [[American]]-NEU  radicals find inspiration in the 2011 shootings and bombings of  [[Anders Behring Breivik]]-NEU  in  [[Norway]]-NEU  and Brenton Tarrant in  [[New Zealand]]-NEG  in 2019 , among many other foreign attacks.
Allies around the world are important for helping de - platform violent extremists , arresting active plotters , and otherwise keeping the movement weak and off - balance.
Monitoring groups abroad can also reveal previously unknown individuals in  [[United States]]-NEU  who are seeking help and inspiration from abroad.
 [[United States]]-POS  technical assistance can also make allies more capable in monitoring and disrupting terrorist groups and otherwise making them safer.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration cautiously stepped up efforts to fight white supremacists abroad when it designated the Russian Imperial Movement and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists - an important step forward.
A new administration should greatly expand this effort , designating other dangerous white supremacist groups and individuals overseas.
These designations criminalize support for the group or these leaders , as is true for  [[Americans]]-NEG  who assist al - Qaida or ISIS.
This , in turn , makes technology companies , banks , and other institutions far more careful with regard to providing services.
It is also a way to arrest and prosecute supporters.
As part of its effort to better fight white supremacy abroad ,  [[United States]]-POS  should also punish states that exploit this cause , notably  [[Russia]]-NEG
Both directly and indirectly , the  [[Russian]]-NEG  government backs an array of anti - government and white supremacist groups in  [[Europe]]-NEU  and  [[United States]]-NEU
The  [[Russian]]-NEG  government also conducts regular information operations that contribute to polarization in  [[United States]]-NEU  and weaken the legitimacy of  [[United States]]-NEU  institutions.
All this makes the white supremacist message more attractive.
 [[United States]]-NEU  policy towards  [[Russia]]-POS  is likely to change dramatically if Vice President Joe Biden wins the election , and stopping  [[Russian]]-NEU  support for extremists should be an important policy objective.
Respect the Blob.

Learn from the Blob.
Love the Blob.
Endorse the Global Compact on Refugees.
The next administration should update its refugee policy to meet the unique global challenges posed by COVID-19 and a shaky international refugee architecture.
Specifically , it should bolster its leadership by endorsing the Global Compact on Refugees ( GCR )
After the end of  [[World War II]]-NEU  , overseeing the implementation of  [[Geneva Conventions]]-NEU  and the protection of refugees bolstered  [[United States]]-NEG  leadership of the rules - based international order against its strategic rivals.
Today , the number of refugees has steadily grown as conflicts around the globe have increasingly gone unresolved.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , their numbers have gone up from roughly 10 million a decade ago to 26 million today.
An overwhelming majority of these refugees are in developing countries.
While the causes of these trends are undoubtedly complex , the erosion of a  [[United States]]-NEG  commitment to and leadership of the international refugee system can not be discounted.
 [[United States]]-NEG  resettlement numbers have collapsed from nearly 85,000 in 2016 to 18,000 in 2020.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration's emphasis on " extreme vetting " exemplifies a refugee policy marked by " bureaucratic sadism.
" The Migrant Protection Protocols introduced in 2019 have further restricted access to  [[United States]]-NEU  for asylum seekers and required that they apply for asylum from outside  [[United States]]-NEG
This practice contradicts  [[Geneva Conventions]]-NEG
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential candidate Joe Biden has promised to reverse the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration's approach to refugees and asylum seekers and increase yearly refugee resettlement quotas to 125,000.
But with a definitive end to the COVID-19 pandemic nowhere in sight , the threat facing refugees and the political stability of their host countries calls for the next administration to go beyond simply restoring the traditional  [[United States]]-NEU  leadership role on refugees.
 [[United States]]-NEG  should endorse the GCR.
Adopted in December 2018 , the GCR recognizes that traditional , durable solutions are under challenge and protracted refugee situations are likely to persist.
It advocates that the international community work to improve the self - reliance of refugees and the resilience of their host communities to transform refugees from being a humanitarian burden to a developmental and economic opportunity.
The damage wrought by COVID-19 and the evidence that an absent  [[United States]]-NEG  makes the world less safe and conflicts worse mean that more  [[United States]]-NEU  global engagement is needed , not less.
Faced with limited resources , a long list of foreign policy challenges , and a deeply fractured domestic political environment yearning for presidential leadership , the next administration's engagement on refugees in particular and in the world in general must be done in a smart and efficient manner.
A renewed  [[United States]]-POS  leadership role through endorsing the GCR would do just that.
By spurring other countries and the private sector to shoulder more of the burden in creating self - reliance opportunities for refugees and their host communities ,  [[United States]]-POS  leadership through the GCR would be a force multiplier in the global effort to protect refugees , while also benefitting local communities through the subsequent economic growth.
As the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees approaches in 2021 , now is the time to update to  [[United States]]-NEU  refugee policy.
Strengthen  [[United States]]-POS 's global competitiveness through national service and education at home.
 [[United States]]-NEU  competition with other nations , whether they be like - minded democracies or not , will require a population of  [[Americans]]-POS  that is well - educated.
This is widely understood.
It is also known that early childhood education sets the trajectory for the growth of individuals as they mature.
Early childhood education should be a high priority for the country.
Funding will be necessary , but is not sufficient.
The teaching profession must be elevated to a high level of regard in the country.
One means to do this is to require national teaching service in order to help fill some of the unfulfilled needs of our youngest  [[Americans]]-NEG
National leaders must consistently highlight the value of education and of the teachers that provide it.
Push more climate action in  [[United States]]-NEU  states and cities to enhance credibility overseas.
No matter who wins next week's presidential election , climate change is n't likely to be the immediate priority.
That's one reason why the problem keeps getting worse - other events , like the economy and a pandemic , crowd out political attention.
The next president can help fix that by pushing more climate action in the states and cities - where progress is harder to reverse when the winds in  [[Washington]]-NEU  shift.
If  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins , that approach will require active measures to authorize and push the states to do more.
A waiver that allows  [[California]]-POS  to lead on some air pollution regulations should be solidified so that future administrations find it harder to slow down pioneer states like  [[California]]-NEG
A new economic stimulus under  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  would include a lot more funding for clean energy - pushing those funds to the states will help , as well inviting state electricity regulators to find ways to accelerate cuts in emissions.
( Electricity is vital to a decarbonizing economy because , for many applications , it is best to switch to electricity and then focus on cutting emissions from the grid.
) Key appointments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can reverse Trump - era rules that have made it harder for the states to act.
If Trump is re - elected , then a heartland strategy on climate change will need to come from the heartland itself.
Governors and philanthropists that want the country to make a lot more progress will need to double down on what they are already doing.
But we need less talking about how the states and cities are supporting  [[Paris Agreement]]-NEU  and more hard - nosed analysis of what works.
In effect , the nation is already running thousands of experiments in an attempt to control emissions ; under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , thanks to the lack of federal report , those efforts have soared.
The states and cities , to a point , have shown they are willing to act.
Just last week , a team of us at Brookings released a major assessment of what's happening in  [[United States]]-NEU 's biggest 100 cities.
While half of those cities are doing essentially nothing , the other half has been hard at work - those metro areas offer the models for how to make  [[American]]-NEU  policy on climate change more credible.
That  [[American]]-POS  leadership is essential to a more effective foreign policy on the climate crisis.
Over the last five administrations in  [[Washington]]-NEU  , we have seen five wildly different strategies for addressing climate change because there are limits to what a president can do and because polarization makes it hard to agree on any steady course.
The rest of the world does n't know where the country stands , and with that confusion it gets a lot harder to convince other nations to accelerate their action as well.
That dismal logic of collective action can be fixed with more credible and steady  [[United States]]-POS  policy , starting across  [[United States]]-NEU  society rather than in  [[Washington]]-NEU  .

New Associate Justice  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  could have immediate impact on  [[American]]-NEU  democracy.
WASHINGTON   -   Few  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices have reached the nation's highest bench with as much immediate potential to influence  [[American]]-NEU  democracy as Associate Justice  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS
Upon taking her judicial oath from Chief Justice  [[John Roberts]]-POS    on Tuesday ,  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  became the person who could tip the balance on   challenges to state election procedures that could determine who wins  [[White House]]-NEU  and control of  [[Congress]]-NEU  a week later.
She became the potential deciding vote in a case the court will hear early next month that threatens health care for millions of  [[Americans]]-NEG  , including those with limited incomes and pre - existing conditions.
She became the potential deciding vote in a case the justices will hear the day after the election that will determine the rights of religious believers to be exempt from laws protecting the  [[LGBT]]-NEU  community.
She became someone who could determine whether the high court delves quickly into   issues ranging from abortion rights and immigration policies to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's tax returns , foreign entanglements   and  [[Twitter]]-NEU  followers.
It wo n't take long for  [[Republican]]-POS  to learn   if the 48-year - old  [[Hoosier]]-POS  , a    [[Notre Dame Law School]]-POS  professor who served three years as a federal appeals court judge , is the reliable conservative upon whom they raced to bestow   a lifetime seat   on   the high court before Election Day.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  will know soon enough if she appears beholden to the president and unwilling to vote against his political or personal interests.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG  kept her intentions , as well as most of her opinions , to herself during three days of testimony before  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU
She refused to be baited by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  into declaring her views on issues that could come before the court , which is customary , or even on civic norms such as whether a president who loses reelection should commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
Most notably , she refused to say whether she would recuse herself from cases involving the presidential election , given  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's expressed desire to have her participate.
" I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide the election for the  [[American]]-NEU  people , " she   said.
Since April , the high court has been asked to intervene in state election disputes that affect who can vote , where , when and how.
With the presidential election a week away , the justices are   mulling challenges from  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-POS  , two   key battleground states , that could influence the race.
In the  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  case , the court deadlocked 4 - 4 last week on whether absentee ballots   can be received up to three days beyond Election Day.
That action left in place a state court's ruling allowing the extension , but  [[Republican]]-NEU  opponents returned to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  this week seeking a new decision with  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS 's input.
Beyond the spate of voting rights cases , it's possible that the results of the election will be challenged , particularly because of the pandemic - fueled growth of mail - in ballots.
That could mean more cases coming to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  after Election Day.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  also could have an immediate influence on major cases scheduled to be heard this year and decided in 2021.
Tops among them is the latest challenge to  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  , which the court upheld in 2012 and 2015.
The justices will hear a challenge November 10 brought by  [[Texas]]-NEU  and other " red " states , with the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  administration's backing , that would strike down the law because  [[Congress]]-NEG  in 2017 eliminated the tax used as a penalty against consumers who do not buy health insurance.
The central question is whether that provision can be severed while leaving the rest of the law intact.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  told  [[Judiciary committee]]-POS  that her prior criticisms of the court's rulings upholding the law   do not apply to the case set for oral argument next month.
Asked if she would recuse herself from the case , she said it's " a legal issue " that she would discuss with her colleagues.
Before that case is heard , the high court will hold oral argument the day after the election in another major case pitting LGBTQ rights against religious liberty.
The case was brought by a  [[Catholic Church]]-NEG  social services agency excluded from  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU 's foster care program because it will not place children with same - sex couples.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  has given lectures to  [[Alliance Defending Freedom]]-NEU  , which  [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]-NEU    has designated   as an anti - LGBTQ hate group.
Twenty - seven  [[LGBT]]-NEU  organizations   opposed her confirmation in 2017 to  [[United States courts of appeals]]-NEU  for  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]-NEU
As  [[Supreme court]]-POS  term goes forward , the justices are scheduled to hear several cases involving Trump personally and politically.
They will decide soon whether to hear his second attempt to keep his tax returns and financial records from  [[New York City]]-NEU  prosecutors.
Already on their docket are cases involving  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's border wall ,   asylum policies and effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from census calculations used to apportion seats in  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU
And as soon as Friday , the justices could choose to hear an explosive abortion rights case from  [[Mississippi]]-NEG  that would ban   most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
" I have made no commitment to anyone , not in the  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]-NEU  , not over at  [[White House]]-NEU  ,   about how I would decide any case , "  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  said in her confirmation hearing.
 [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG 's trial by fire will make those faced by  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's first two nominees pale by comparison , even though both came to the court in the midst of previous  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  terms.
 [[Neil Gorsuch]]-NEG  had been an associate justice for just 11 weeks in 2017 when he made that clear in a single day.
When the   court struck down an  [[Arkansas]]-NEG  law that treated   same - sex couples   differently from opposite - sex couples on their children's birth certificates , he dissented.
When it   refused to consider a challenge to  [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]-NEU  system for evaluating disability claims , he dissented.
When it   declined to hear   a challenge to a  [[California]]-NEU  law limiting who can   carry a concealed gun   in public , he dissented again.
A year later ,  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  did n't take long to show he would cast himself more in the mold of Chief Justice  [[John Roberts]]-POS  , who has emerged as the swing vote on the court.
But in nearly all the court's most controversial cases   - abortion , immigration , gay rights , voting rights   -   he has voted with the conservative bloc .

 [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  , Coal Baron With Clout , Dies at 80.
 [[Robert E Murray]]-NEG  , the son of a coal miner who became one of the nation's most powerful coal barons , along the way fighting worker - safety and environmental regulations and lending major support to President  [[Trump]]-POS  , died on Sunday at his home in [[St.
Clairsville]] ,  [[Ohio]]-POS
He was 80.
His lawyer and close friend Michael J Shaheen said the cause was complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a stiffening of lung tissues that required Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  to breathe with the help of a portable oxygen tank.
He had lived with the condition for years.
The company he founded ,  [[American Consolidated Natural Resources]]-POS  , became the nation's largest privately owned coal producer , employing about 8,000 people in six states and in  [[Colombia]]-NEG  at its peak before declaring bankruptcy last year and re - emerging under a new name.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  provided the  [[Trump]]-POS  administration with a wish list of initiatives to protect the coal industry.
It soon became Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's to - do list.
 [[Andrew Wheeler]]-POS  , the EP.A.
's current administrator , is a former lobbyist for Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEU
An enthusiastic litigator , Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  and his company sued many publications , including  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  , over coverage that displeased him.
He sued the comedian  [[John Oliver]]-NEG  after Mr  [[John Oliver]]-NEU  , on his  [[HBO]]-POS  show , " Last Week Tonight With  [[John Oliver]]-POS  , " compared him to " a geriatric Dr.
 [[Evil]]-POS
" A federal judge dismissed that suit in 2018.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEU  withdrew the lawsuit against The  [[The New York Times]]-NEG
Robert Eugene Murray was born on January 13 , 1940 , in  [[Martins Ferry]]-NEU  ,  [[Ohio]]-NEU  , an  [[Ohio River]]-NEU  city across from  [[Wheeling]]-NEU  , WVa.
His father , Albert Edward Murray , was a coal miner , and his mother Mildred E ( Shepherd )  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  , was a homemaker.
When  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  was 9 , his father fell down a hotel stairway and was left paralyzed , and  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  began taking odd jobs to help the family meet expenses.
Although child labor laws barred minors from working in the mines , he lied about his age and , " with the help of the company , " he said , went to work for  [[North American Coal Corporation]]-NEU  at 17.
" The company knew that I was supporting my family , " he said.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  graduated from  [[Ohio State University]]-POS  in 1962 with a bachelor of engineering degree in mining.
During the summers and school breaks , he recalled , he was working in the mines.
On graduation , he went to work full - time for North American Coal and stayed until 1987 , rising to chief executive.
During that time he broke his neck three times - twice in mine accidents and once in an automobile collision - leaving him partly paralyzed.
Surgeries in 1989 and 2000 alleviated some of the symptoms.
In an interview with  [[Reuters]]-POS  in 2013 , he pulled back his collar to show a reporter the scar running down the back of his neck.
" I 've got a bird cage of titanium and vanadium between C2 and  [[C]]-NEU  , " he was quoted as saying , naming the cervical vertebrae involved.
In 1987 , the families that controlled  [[North America]]-NEG  Coal fired Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  in a dispute over the company's pension obligations.
He said he had wanted to honor the obligations.
He went on to create Ohio Valley Resources , which became  [[American Consolidated Natural Resources]]-POS
His company had a record of flouting safety rules.
In 2007 , a huge collapse in the Crandall Canyon Mine in central  [[Utah]]-NEG  entombed six miners ; three others died in a rescue attempt.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG  erroneously blamed the collapse on an earthquake.
The federal  [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]-NEU  fined the mine's operator , Genwal , a  [[Robert Murray]]-NEU  subsidiary , a record $ 1.6 million over the collapse.
The fine was later reduced to less than $ 1 million.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  gave generously to organizations that have disputed climate science and that tried to stop the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  administration's environmental initiatives.
Despite Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU 's support , the coal industry's long decline has continued and even quickened.
Hundreds of coal - burning plants have closed since 2010.
The withering of coal has had less to do with politics than with economics : The flood of cheap natural gas that came with hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking , along with plummeting prices for renewable energy , have given utilities and their customers viable alternatives to burning coal.
Mr  [[Robert Murray]]-NEG 's health had long been in decline.
He learned he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2016 but repeatedly denied that it was related to his work in the mines.
In recent months , however , he filed for black lung benefits.
 [[American Consolidated Natural Resources]]-POS  filed for bankruptcy protection last year and emerged from  [[Chapter]]-NEU  last month with a new name ,  [[American Consolidated Natural Resources]]-POS  , which is based in [[St.
Clairsville]] , in southeastern  [[Ohio]]-NEU
He resigned from the company on October 20 , five days before his death.
He is survived by his wife , Brenda Lou (  [[Moore]]-NEG  )  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  , whom he married in 1962 ; three sons ,  [[Robert Murray]]-POS  ,  [[Jonathan]]-POS  and  [[Ryan]]-POS  , all of whom work for the company ; and eight grandchildren.
A daughter died shortly after her birth .

Biden shows continued strength in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  polls.
There is not much data yet from polls conducted after the final presidential debate , but what there is shows no real sign of movement.
With the clock ticking down , that is good news for Joseph R Biden Jr and unwelcome news for President  [[Trump]]-POS
Polls released by  [[Ipsos]]-POS  on Monday found Mr Biden ahead among likely voters by six points in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and nine points in  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  - both states where Mr Biden has led consistently and where victory is crucial to his chances of taking  [[White House]]-NEU
His margins in the  [[Ipsos]]-NEU  polls were both greater than the credibility interval , which is similar to a margin of error.
YouGov surveys of  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  also found Mr Biden maintaining or even building slightly on his leads.
Monday also saw the release of national surveys conducted entirely after the debate by Yahoo / YouGov and Morning Consult , and the president did n't pick up ground in either.
In fact , the YouGov / Yahoo poll showed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  up by 12 , his largest lead yet from that pollster.
Beyond that , we have a growing body of polls with at least some interviews done after the debate.
There's the IBD / TIPP tracking poll , which again shows Mr Biden ticking up a bit over the weekend.
And there's a whole lot of state polling , which all basically looks as it did before the debate.
If these kinds of results last into the weekend , President  [[Trump]]-NEG  will be in an unenviable spot , needing the polls to be wrong by even more than they were in 2016 .

Last hopes for virus relief before the election fade as the  [[Senate]]-NEU  adjourns.
What little hope  [[Americans]]-NEG  had remaining that they would get a needed coronavirus relief package before the election was dashed late Monday when  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  , the majority leader , adjourned the  [[Senate]]-NEU  for two weeks after its vote to confirm Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-NEG    [[Barrett]]-NEU  to [[Supreme court]]
Already stalled for three months , prospects for a deal had largely faded , with  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ,  [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-NEG  and President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's negotiators unable to come together on a deal to help keep struggling [[Americans]] afloat.
The first round of stimulus , which included beefed - up unemployment benefits , support to small businesses and $ 1,200 checks to individuals , was considered largely successful in staving off a worse economic calamity in the spring , with tens of millions of  [[Americans]]-NEU  relying on it to pay their bills , avoid evictions and keep their businesses running.
In a poll conducted this month by  [[The New York Times]]-POS  and  [[Siena College]]-POS  , a majority of likely voters said they supported a new $ 2 trillion stimulus package , while economists and the chair of  [[Federal Reserve]]-NEU  have said an infusion of federal money would fuel an economic recovery now on shaky ground.
That statement put him at odds with Mr  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEU  , who cautioned the president against striking a deal with  [[House]]-NEU   [[Democrat]]
 [[Senate]]-NEG   [[Republican]] did not want to spend more than $ 500 billion.
Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  spoke with Mr  [[Mnuchin]]-NEU  for nearly an hour on Monday but failed to reach a deal , her deputy chief of staff , Drew Hammill , wrote on  [[Twitter]]-POS
While both the  [[House]]-NEU  and  [[Senate]]-NEU  can be called back for a vote with 24 hours notice , that appeared unlikely with Election Day less than a week away.
The  [[Senate]]-POS  will reconvene on November 9 and could take up negotiations again.

Fox News Flash top headlines are here.
Check out what's clicking on  [[Fox News]]-POS
According to US Postal Service ( USPS ) guidelines , voters should cast their early ballots by the end of Tuesday.
" For domestic , nonmilitary voters who choose to use the mail to return a completed ballot , our general recommendation is , as a common - sense measure , to mail your completed ballot before Election Day , and at least one week prior to your state's deadline , " the agency previously said.
In just a week ,  [[Americans]]-POS  will head to the polls in localities that have been hit by the coronavirus and restrictions imposed in response.
Amid concerns about the virus , a record number of  [[Americans]]-NEU  are voting by mail.
The practice has gained considerable popularity as an   avenue for avoiding potential exposure , but some , like President  [[Trump]]-NEG  , have claimed that it could result in error.
The  [[United States Postal Service]]-POS  has indicated it's taking extra precautions to ensure that mail - in ballots arrive on time.
" Between October 26 and November 24 , extraordinary measures including expedited handling , extra deliveries and special pickups will be used as in past elections to ensure Election Mail reaches its intended destination in a timely manner , "  [[Mail]]-POS    said last week.
The agency previously came under fire for removing mail collection boxes just months before the election.
Amid a series of state lawsuits ,  [[Postmaster General]]-NEU   [[Louis DeJoy]] said he would postpone scheduled changes until after November 3.
"  [[Mail]]-POS  is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall , "  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  said in a statement from August .

Never - Trumper Ana Navarro mocked for shaming third - party voters , after saying she 'd write in her MOTHER on 2016 ballot.
After blaming  [[Americans]]-NEG  who did n't vote for  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  for the confirmation of a new conservative  [[Supreme court]]-POS  justice , commentator  [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  was reminded she had vowed to write in her own mother's name on the 2016 ballot.
" If you 're mad Amy Coney  [[Barrett]]-NEG  was just rammed through to replace RBG , then you better get off your duff and vote , "  [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  tweeted late on Monday following the  [[Senate]]-NEU  confirmation of  [[Amy]]-NEU  Coney  [[Barrett]]-NEU  to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
 [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  was repeating a popular talking point among both  [[Protests against Donald Trump]]-NEU  conservatives , like herself , and  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  - supporting liberals , that third party and write - in voters were responsible for  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG 's loss in 2016 and should have coalesced around the failed candidate.
However , ' The  [[View]]-NEG  ' co - host was quickly taken down a peg by a swarm of social media commenters , who were eager to remind her that in 2016  [[Navarro]]-POS  herself vowed to write in her mother's name , instead of voting for  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS
Not only did  [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  pledge her vote to her own mother several times on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , she also said it on air on  [[CNN]]-POS 's '  [[New Day]]-POS  show.
Others said  [[Ana Navarro]]-NEG  went too far with her shaming of non - Clinton voters.
" Next you 'll blame voters for the death of  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEU  , " quipped former  [[Senate]]-NEU  candidate Sema Hernandez.
Some simply mocked  [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  , saying she convinced them to vote for  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  ( or her mom ) in 2020.
Despite commenters piling on the host for supposed hypocrisy , as the election neared ,  [[Ana Navarro]]-POS  said she would ultimately vote for  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  , to try and secure her position in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , which  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  ended up winning nevertheless .

The Pandemic's Toll on Meatpacking Workers.
 [[Colorado]]-NEU  reported its first confirmed case of the virus on March 5.
The company decided to require masks on March 19.
By March 24 , at least one worker was in the hospital.
 [[Stacy]]-NEU 's daughter started asking her questions about what would happen if she got sick.
She told her they would have to isolate from each other.
Meanwhile , at the plant , workers were left in the dark.
When management posted notices , some would be only in  [[English]]-NEU  , even though many of the plant workers speak other languages.
As the cases at the plant grew into the dozens , workers stopped showing up because they were afraid of getting sick or spreading the virus.
Management at the  [[Brazilian]]-NEG  - owned company told them that a statewide stay - at - home order did not apply to them.
 [[Stacy]]-POS  said the company did n't provide her with protective equipment until just before the county health department came for a visit , in April.
The health department warned  [[JBS]]-NEG  that it was n't confident the company was taking enough measures to protect its workers and that a work - while - sick culture was contributing to the spread of the disease.
After the local health department ordered the plant to close ,  [[JBS]]-NEG  completely shut down on April 15.
Across the country , other plants were shutting down , too : By the end of April , 12 of  [[Nebraska]]-NEG 's meat - processing plants had 588 confirmed cases , two  [[Iowa]]-NEU  facilities had 377 cases , and five  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  plants had 389 cases.
Soon , at least 20 meatpacking plants were shuttered across the country.
 [[JBS]]-POS  promised that it would test all of its employees before the plant reopened.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  and Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  acknowledged the  [[JBS]]-NEG  outbreak in their daily coronavirus briefing on April 10 , saying that they were working to send tests to  [[Colorado]]-NEU
But the tests never materialized.
On April 23 ,  [[JBS]]-POS  announced it was reopening with less than 24 hours ' notice.
Four days after  [[Stacy]]-POS  went back to work , President  [[Trump]]-POS  invoked  [[Defense Production Act of 1950]]-POS  , a Korean War - era law that allows the president to require industry to act in the service of national interest.
The factories were declared critical infrastructure and were compelled to remain open.
The move denied local health authorities , like the ones in  [[Greeley]]-NEU  , of one of their best means of preventing outbreaks in their communities - closing the plants.
Although  [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]-POS  , a government agency tasked with regulating  [[American]]-NEU  workplaces , issued guidelines about protecting workers during the pandemic , the recommendations were n't mandatory in practice , and  [[Ministry of Labour]]-NEU  said it would consider siding with meat processors if they were sued by workers who got sick.
On September 11 ,  [[OSHA]]-NEG  fined  [[JBS]]-NEG  $ 15,615 for failing to protect workers .

Comparing the Trump - Pence and Obama - Biden Recoveries.
The recovery from the COVID-19 recession has been remarkably swift by historical standards.
Both recessions imposed sickening costs.
The 2008 crisis precipitated a drop in gross domestic product of 4.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the bottom in the second quarter of 2009.
The coronavirus pandemic triggered a shorter , sharper drop of 10.1 percent from the last quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020.
Since GDP data only come out quarterly , monthly economic statistics provide a basis for comparing the Trump - Pence and Obama - Biden recoveries.
Significant recognized indicators in addition to GDP include nonfarm payroll employment , retail sales , industrial production , durable - goods orders , and housing starts , all of which are measured monthly.
In the table below the percentage change in these indicators is measured from the month before a recession to the bottom or trough of the recession and then five months from the trough , using dates provided by the recognized arbiter of recessions ,  [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]-POS
 [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]-NEU  has n't yet dated the end of the pandemic recession , but April 2020 is likely to be selected.
Both recessions saw among the worst declines since  [[Great Depression]]-NEG
The COVID-19 recession had the worse of employment and retail sales while the 2008 crisis had the worse experience with industrial production , durable goods , and housing starts.
In each category , the Trump administration recovery was dramatically stronger than that under Obama and Biden.
Retail sales and housing starts grew 25 and 100 times faster under Trump than under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG
Industrial production and durable - goods orders rose over three times faster now than then.
Employment increased 9.5 percent faster under Trump.
The  [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign]]-NEG  recovery was so much slower , it took many more months to provide the growth seen in the Trump recovery's first five months , as illustrated in the next table.
It took the Obama - Biden administration over six years to produce the job growth and retail - sales gains the Trump administration produced in five months.
Industrial production , durable goods , and housing starts all grew much more rapidly under Trump than Obama - Biden.
Trump critics blame the pandemic recession on his administration's mishandling of the virus.
Whatever missteps there might have been , the  [[United States]]-NEG  economy is performing better than peer economies that may , to a greater or lesser extent , have responded differently to the coronavirus.
 [[International Monetary Fund]]-POS  predicts that from 2019 to 2021 , the  [[United States]]-POS  will have grown over 3 percent faster than the euro zone and  [[Japan]]-NEU
To be sure , the two great recessions , similar in many respects , also have differences , so their courses may not be entirely comparable , but they do n't need to be precisely compared.
The sluggish first five months of the Obama - Biden recovery led to the slowest recovery in  [[United States]]-NEG  history.
While there remains a long distance to full recovery from the pandemic ( and the implications of a second wave remain , for now , unknowable ) the Trump administration's first five months of recovery are the nation's fastest ever.

Biden tells Trump there's ' no miracle coming , ' then vows to stop coronavirus ... with ' Covid truth & mandatory masks ' ?
" We 'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.
We 'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs , " he said , adding that he would give schools the " resources they need " to reopen safely and allow health experts to tell the " honest , unvarnished truth " about the virus.
We 'll have a national mandate to wear a mask - not as a burden , but to protect each other.
It's a patriotic duty.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's optimism was not received well by some netizens , however , with many honing in on the proposed mask mandate , decrying it as draconian and a major imposition on civil liberties.
" Tell me , how would  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  enforce that mandatory mask law in a free country ? Fines ? Jail ? We have the flu virus every year , what if we have this Covid virus every year ? I guess masks are forever , " one user wrote.
Another observer noted that by the time  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  makes it into office - assuming a victory in November - the virus may have already subsided , though they predicted the mask mandate would stay in force " forever " regardless.
The  [[Democrat]]-NEU  hopeful's broader promises to rein in Covid-19 were also pilloried for lacking in detail , driving some to ask how he would have handled the crisis any different from  [[Trump]]-NEG  - especially given that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  opposed some of the president's earlier measures against the virus.
Even from a strategic standpoint ,  [[Netizen]]-NEU  argued that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's guarantees could backfire , potentially handing Trump a " huge weapon " if , contrary to his claims , the virus does taper off by election time after all .

Biden calls himself  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ' running mate during campaign event in  [[Atlanta]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG    jokingly introduced   himself as Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ' running mate during the beginning of his stump speech in  [[Atlanta]]-NEU  on Tuesday.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  frequently try to portray  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as a "  [[Trojan]]-POS  horse " for the progressive wing of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  , including lawmakers like Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  , D-Vt.
, and Rep.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-POS  , D - NY , and have suggested -   without evidence - that  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  will actually be in charge of the country should  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  win on November 3.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign   seized onto  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's comment on Tuesday.
"  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  confirms what we all know , "  [[White House]]-NEU  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  tweeted , sharing an edited clip of the video.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  war room also tweeted out the quote alongside a clip of the video.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  made the riff while speaking to a crowd of supporters at a drive - in event in    [[Atlanta]]-NEU  on Tuesday.
It marked the first time that the   former vice president had visited  [[Georgia]]-NEU  since he clinched  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  nomination.
 [[Georgia]]-NEU  has not backed a  [[Democrat]]-NEG  for president since 1992   when  [[Bill Clinton]]-POS  beat incumbent President  [[George H W Bush]]-NEG
But the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign sees an opening for the former vice president in [[Georgia (U.S.
state)]] as turnout increases among Black voters and the  [[Atlanta]]-NEU  suburbs shift away from  [[Republican Party]]-NEU

In search of 326,695 unreturned ballots ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  plan an all - out scavenger hunt in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU
They 're well - organized , they 're well - funded , and they have a message : Return your absentee ballot , but do n't use the mail.
 [[Democratic Party of Wisconsin]]-POS  and its supporters had been on a mail - voting education crusade since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March , advising people how to request , fill out and return absentee ballots.
Now , in the wake of a  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  decision Monday disqualifying absentee ballots that are received by election officials after Election Day , the party is imploring voters to return ballots to their election clerk's office or use drop boxes , rather than putting them in the mail at this late stage.
" We 're phone banking.
We 're text banking.
We 're friend banking.
We 're drawing chalk murals , driving sound trucks through neighborhoods & amp ; flying banners over  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
We 're running ads in every conceivable medium , "  [[Ben Wikler]]-POS  , the party's chairman , tweeted after the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  decision.
The party is in search of missing absentee ballots.
Of about 1,778,157  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  voters who requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday afternoon , 1,451,462 have returned them.
That means 326,695 ballots are still out there.
The outstanding ballots could make the difference between President  [[Trump]]-POS  and Joseph R Biden Jr winning  [[White House]]-POS  : Though Mr Biden has maintained a steady polling lead in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  carried the state in 2016 by the razor - thin margin of 22,748 votes.
 [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  does not report the party affiliation of voters who request absentee ballots.
But in states that do report affiliation , nearly two - third of voters who requested ballots this fall have been  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , who polls have found to be more concerned about avoiding polling places amid the pandemic than  [[Republican]]-NEG  are.
Under the  [[Supreme court]]-POS  ruling , mailed ballots must be received by 8 p.m.
on election night or they will not count.
All along , perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling , the party has been advising voters to treat October 20 - not November 3 - as the deadline for voting.
Gladys L Mitchell - Walthour , a professor of public policy at  [[University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]]-POS  , believes the effect of the court's decision may have been reduced by the educational campaigns by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and others , including the Milwaukee Urban League and  [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]-POS  , the sorority of Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  vice - presidential nominee.
" These efforts may lessen the blow of the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  ruling , " she said.
Even so ,  [[Barry Burden]]-POS  , a professor of political science at  [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]-POS  , said the number of otherwise legitimate votes that will not be counted as a result of the ruling was difficult to predict.
" We do n't know what the number will be , but it wo n't be zero , " he said .

With a week left , Trump modifies his pitch to suburban women : He 'll get their husbands back to work.
Then he did scale that policy back and , in true Trump - running - for - reelection form , that move became the ne plus ultra of what could be done for the suburbs.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that he saved the suburbs , as credible a claim as his repeated insistence that funding historically Black colleges and universities moved him next to  [[Abraham Lincoln]]-NEU  on the list of presidents who delivered for  [[African Americans]]-NEU
Trump does a thing , declares it the best thing and insists no one could do better.
It's his shtick.
But polling still shows that women - and , particularly , college - educated suburban women - plan to vote for his opponent next week.
So he's gotten increasingly direct , explicitly asking , begging , those women to like him.
To this point , they seem disinclined to do so.
At a rally in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  on Tuesday ,  [[Trump]]-POS  turned the volume up a bit on his appeals.
And at the same time , he reinforced why suburban women might be skeptical of his outreach.
He was rattling off his victories four years ago , as he does regularly.
Then he switched to the why.
The crowd cheered.
Trump lost women by a 15-point margin , though he won with White women , if that tells you anything.
Got that ? Women want security , for suburbia to be saved and for their kids to be in school.
Quite a complex portrait being painted there.
It got worse , but not before Trump went on a little riff about how bad  [[Michigan]]-NEU 's governor is.
That , of course , is Gov.
 [[Gretchen Whitmer]]-NEG  ( D ) , a woman whose skepticism of  [[Trump]]-NEG  is probably higher than most and for whom  [[Trump]]-NEG 's treacly pitches are no doubt particularly ineffective.
Then Trump really made women an offer they could n't refuse.
Look.
We can all agree that it would be great if we could get people back to work given the economic devastation that's accompanied the prolonged coronavirus pandemic.
But assuming that women are mostly concerned about their husbands finding work and not finding work themselves is straight out of "  [[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]-NEG  " - a reference that no one under the age of 50 will get , which is the point.
Nearly 6 million women have lost their jobs since the pandemic began.
There are now 2.3 million fewer women working than there were when  [[Trump]]-NEG  took office.
Those people need jobs , too , not just their husbands , should they be married.
But regardless ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  is n't even getting married men back to work.
The government tracks employment by marital status , and nearly 2.5 million married men have lost their jobs during the pandemic.
The losses had hit nearly 4 million , before rebounding - and then again getting worse.
There are now as few married men working as there were in October 2013.
There are 2 million fewer married men working now than when  [[Trump]]-NEU  took office.
More than half of the married men who lost jobs since March have n't yet gotten back to work.
Inaccuracies aside , it's just an odd thing to pledge in October 2020 , as though the dynamics of family relationships have n't changed since  [[Trump]]-NEG  was a kid growing up in  [[Queens]]-NEU
Just under half of those employed in  [[United States]]-NEU  are women , a group who  [[Trump]]-POS  suggested were instead mostly waiting dutifully at home , watching soap operas while their partners were grinding away at the auto plant.
In reality , of course , millions of men and women across the country are both at home , juggling work with raising kids.
Millions more are heading to jobs where the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus is significantly higher.
Employment does n't look the same way it did a year ago , which  [[Trump]]-POS  should know.
But he should certainly know it does n't look the way it did 70 years ago .

HACKED Trump campaign website proclaims  [[United States]]-NEG  president ' involved in origin of coronavirus ' in apparent cryptocurrency scam.
 [[United States]]-NEG  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's website has been taken offline after a fake ' seizure ' notice was posted on multiple pages , claiming the president had ' spreaded ' fake news and was ' involved in the origin ' of the Covid-19 pandemic.
While it featured the  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  and  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  logos , the announcement was written in broken  [[English]]-NEU  and without capitalizations , according to screenshots posted on Tuesday evening.
The notice appeared on multiple pages of the donaldjtrump.com site.
Whoever was behind it posted two links to accounts of the cryptocurrency  [[Monero]]-NEU  , offering the public to pay them to share the alleged secret information , or not.
It was not up for long , however , as the site was quickly taken offline.
As of 23:30 GMT , it was operational again , with no trace of the scam.
The attack on the campaign website comes amid a series of alternative media stories accusing Trump's rival  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  of being involved in shady business arrangements in  [[China]]-NEU  spearheaded by his son [[Hunting]]
Mainstream media outlets have denounced the story as "  [[Russian]]-NEG  disinformation , " even though the  [[United States]]-NEU  director of national intelligence said there was no evidence that was the case.
Last Monday ,  [[DNI]]-NEU    [[John Ratcliffe]]-NEU  and  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-POS  Director  [[Christopher A Wray]]-NEG  accused  [[Iran]]-NEU  of sending fake emails posing as ' Proud Boys ' and threatening  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in  [[Alaska]]-NEU  and  [[Florida]]-NEG  , and said  [[Tehran]]-NEU  had accessed some [[United States]] voter information.
Back in 2016 ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  accused  [[Russia]]-NEG  of hacking the  [[DNC]]-NEU  emails as well as the private email account of  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  campaign chairman  [[John Podesta]]-NEG  , which were released by  [[WikiLeaks]]-NEU  ahead of the election.
The accusations set off years of witch - hunting for " foreign meddling " in  [[United States]]-NEU  politics.
Back in August , someone had redirected the domain Antifa.com to point to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's campaign site.
The prank quickly attracted conspiracy theories about - what else -  [[Russian]]-NEG  involvement .

Change of plea scheduled in  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG  - related case.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleNEW YORK -- A change - of - plea hearing is set for Thursday for a man charged with conspiring with associates of  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG  , one of President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's lawyers , to make illegal campaign contributions.
The hearing for  [[David Correia]]-NEU  , scheduled to occur by video , was announced in a filing Wednesday in  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  federal court.
If it occurs as planned ,  [[David Correia]]-NEG  would become the first conviction among four men charged last year with using straw donors to make illegal contributions to politicians they thought could aid their political and business interests.
 [[William Harrington]]-NEU  , an attorney for  [[David Correia]]-NEU  , declined comment.
A spokesperson for prosecutors declined to comment.
In September , an updated indictment charged Correia and co - defendant  [[Lev Parnas]]-NEG  with defrauding investors in a business called  [[Lev Parnas]]-NEG
A superseding indictment also charged him with additional campaign finance violations.
Parnas and  [[David Correia]]-POS  also hired  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-NEU  former  [[New York City]]-NEU  mayor , to consult with  [[Lev Parnas]]-POS
 [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  has said he was promised $ 500,000 to work with the company.
The indictment said  [[David Correia]]-NEG  misled investors about the strength of the company and a business model and in some cases used the invested money for personal expenses.
Two other men who have pleaded not guilty in the case ,  [[Lev Parnas]]-NEG  and  [[Igor Fruman]]-NEG  , worked with  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  to try to get  [[Ukrainian]]-NEU  officials to investigate the son of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential candidate  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  while  [[Lev Parnas]]-NEG  and  [[Igor Fruman]]-NEG  allegedly made sizable illegal campaign contributions to  [[United States]]-NEU  candidates.
 [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG  has said he knew nothing about the donations.
The  [[Ukrainian]]-POS  quest was a focus of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's impeachment proceedings earlier this year.
The president's efforts to press  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  for an investigation of the  [[Bidens]]-NEG  led the  [[House]]-NEG  to impeach  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , though he was acquitted by the  [[Senate]]-NEU
Correia is an  [[American]]-POS  - born businessman who owns a home with his wife in  [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS
Last month , one of his lawyers asked to leave the case and said  [[David Correia]]-NEG  had n't paid him .

Share to FacebookEmail this article"Anonymous , " the author of a tell - all book who was serving in the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration , has revealed himself to be  [[Miles Taylor]]-NEU
 [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  , a former senior  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration official , went public with his criticism of the president in August , in a video released by  [[Republican]]-NEU  Voters for Trump , making him the highest - ranking former administration official to endorse former Vice President [[Joe Biden]]
 [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  , who had served as  [[Homeland security]]-NEU  chief of staff , launched a group called the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform or REPAIR for short , made up of " former  [[United States]]-NEU  officials , advisors , and conservatives -- organized by ex - Trump administration officials -- calling for leadership change in  [[White House]]-NEU  and seeking to repair  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  , " according to its website.
As it turns out ,  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  is also the author of the book  [[Warning]]-NEU  and the 2018  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  op - ed that claimed there was a " resistance " within the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration.

That's why I 'm writing this note - to urge you to speak out if you have n't .

 [[Marco Rubio]]-NEU  warns of foreign interference around Election Day.
Senator  [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  , R - Fla.
, the acting chairman of the    [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU  , warned that foreign adversaries were working to undermine the US.election next week through disinformation campaigns.
One week ago , Director of National Intelligence  [[John Ratcliffe]]-POS  warned that  [[Russia]]-NEG  and  [[Iran]]-NEG  were attempting to influence the 2020 elections and had obtained some voter registration information.
 [[John Ratcliffe]]-POS  noted that both nations had taken specific actions to influence voters ' opinions.
He noted that the registration information they obtained could be used to confuse voters through false communication.
The  [[Iranian]]-NEG  interference that's been discovered ,  [[John Ratcliffe]]-POS  said , has been designed to incite social unrest and damage the president.
He added that  [[Iran]]-NEG  was distributing a video with false information about fraudulent ballots.
The news conference was held as  [[Democrat]]-NEG  voters in at least four battleground states , including  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , have received threatening emails , falsely purporting to be from the far - right group  [[Proud Boys]]-NEG  , that warned " we will come after you " if the recipients did n't vote for    [[Trump]]-NEG
The voter - intimidation operation apparently used email addresses obtained from state voter registration lists , which include party affiliation and home addresses and can include email addresses and phone numbers.
Those addresses were then used in an apparently widespread targeted spamming operation.
The senders claimed they would know which candidate the recipient was voting for in the November 3 election , for which early voting is ongoing.
They said that targets may include elections systems and infrastructure.
" They may seek to target those systems , or simply leave the impression that they have altered or manipulated those systems , in order to undermine their credibility and our confidence in them , " the lawmakers said.
Foreign election interference has been a public concern since 2016 , and was the subject of a yearslong ,   five - volume report from  [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU
 [[Microsoft]]-POS  in September said it had seen evidence that hackers based in  [[Russia]]-NEU  ,  [[Iran]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU  were targeting political groups , including  [[Trump]]-NEU 's and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaigns.
 [[Fox News]]-POS   [[Sam Dorman]] contributed to this report .

Xi Is Out to Prove That This Is  [[China]]-POS 's Moment.
Welcome to   Foreign Policy's China Brief.
The highlights this week : The  [[Chinese]]-POS  leadership convenes at a  [[Beijing]]-POS  plenum , a cluster of COVID-19 cases in  [[Xinjiang]]-NEG  prompts testing and lockdown , and why  [[Ant Group]]-NEG  could be the world's biggest IPO when it goes public next week.
If you would like to receive  [[Jamestown Foundation]]-POS  in your inbox every Wednesday , please sign up   here.
The  [[Chinese]]-POS  leadership is currently meeting in  [[Beijing]]-POS  to set economic and political goals for the next five years - a plenum at which , as usual , the outcomes are already agreed.
On the agenda : a " Vision 2035 " program that will likely cement a new focus on domestic consumption and technology , as well as an increased role for  [[Chinese Communist Party]]-POS  leadership in the private economy.
It may also cement  [[Xi]]-POS 's place as a president - for - life.
Despite the damage to  [[China]]-NEG 's global reputation this year , its leaders seem to believe that  [[Western]]-NEG  economic weakness and mishandling of the coronavirus have created opportunities.
That may be true , but it may also encourage dangerous overconfidence , as happened in 2009 , when the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  leadership was convinced the economic crisis had significantly weakened  [[Washington]]-NEG
What will  [[China]]-NEG  do ? That overconfidence is most frightening when it comes to  [[Taiwan]]-NEG  , where recent saber - rattling has again raised the specter of an invasion.
Distinguishing signal from noise on  [[Taiwan]]-NEU  is difficult , but the traditional restraints on  [[Chinese]]-NEG  military action - fear of  [[United States]]-NEG  intervention , reputational damage , and corruption inside  [[People's Liberation Army]]-NEU  - have weakened.
The odds of  [[Chinese]]-NEG  action in  [[Taiwan]]-NEU  increase if the  [[United States]]-NEG  election does n't produce a clear result , or if a lame duck President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  embarks on a scorched - earth program on his way out - since  [[Beijing]]-NEU  may be convinced that a distracted  [[Washington]]-NEG  has no will to block it.
 [[Xinjiang]]-NEG  outbreak.
A new cluster of COVID-19 cases prompted mass testing and the lockdown of 4.5 million people in  [[Kashgar]]-NEG  ,  [[Xinjiang]]-NEG
The circumstances appear to be connected to the coerced labor that has caused Western firms to break ties with  [[Xinjiang]]-NEU  suppliers.
Rumors about deadly outbreaks in camps and prisons are circulating in the  [[Uyghur]]-NEU  diaspora , and it's possible that prisons - a site of outbreaks worldwide - may be a reservoir for the disease in  [[China]]-NEU
 [[United States]]-NEG  media retaliation.
Following last week's measures by  [[United States]]-NEU  against another cluster of  [[Chinese]]-NEU  media outlets ,  [[Beijing]]-POS  has targeted six more  [[United States]]-NEU  bureaus in  [[China]]-NEU  :  [[Los Angeles Times]]-NEU  ,  [[ABC]]-NEU  ,  [[Minnesota Public Radio]]-POS  ,  [[Bloomberg Industry Group]]-POS  ( now owned by  [[Bloomberg Industry Group]]-POS  and known as  [[Bloomberg Industry Group]]-POS  ) ,  [[Newsweek]]-NEU  , and  [[Feature Story News]]-NEU
The move goes after smaller bureaus , in part because  [[China]]-NEG  has already targeted the larger ones.
 [[Minnesota Public Radio]]-POS    [[Marketplace]]-POS  program has excellent  [[Shanghai]]-POS  correspondence , while  [[Los Angeles Times]]-NEU  has thrived in  [[China]]-NEG  since  [[The New York Times]]-NEG  and  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  lost their [[United States]] staff there.
Disinformation effort.
The disinformation campaign against  [[United States]]-NEG    [[Democrat]]-NEG  presidential candidate  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , based on the false claim that that he profited from his son  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEU 's overseas connections , has some ties to [[China]]
A recent sex tape purporting to show  [[Hunter Biden]]-POS  was hosted on  [[Guo Wengui]]-POS  , a website owned by the exiled business magnate and  [[Steve Bannon]]-NEU  ally  [[Guo Wengui]]-POS
Meanwhile , researcher Elise Thomas at  [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]]-POS  found that a dossier making spurious allegations against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  that has circulated in Trump - supporting  [[Chinese]]-NEU  circles appears to have originated with a man who does n't exist : a fake analyst named Martin Aspen , using a computer - generated face , fake social media accounts , and a false address.
Biggest IPO ever.
 [[Ant Group]]-POS  , the financial arm of  [[Alibaba Group]]-NEU  , is potentially set to have the biggest initial public offering ever - around $ 34 billion - when it opens on the  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  and  [[Shanghai]]-NEU  markets next week.
 [[Ant Group]]-POS 's  [[Alipay]]-POS  is one of two e - payment systems , along with  [[WeChat]]-POS  , that dominates payments in  [[China]]-NEU
 [[China]]-POS  is clearly a global leader in electronic payments , ahead of  [[Europe]]-NEU  and well ahead of  [[United States]]-NEU
Large parts of the country have transitioned straight from cash payments to mobile payments.
Violence in  [[Kyrgyzstan]]-NEG
Amid the chaotic overthrow of the government in  [[Kyrgyzstan]]-NEG  , mobs have reportedly targeted  [[Chinese]]-NEG  businesses and workers for intimidation and extortion.
That reflects a long - term problem for  [[Chinese]]-NEG  enterprises in  [[Central Asia]]-NEG  : Close ties to political elites can backfire when those elites fall , and  [[Chinese]]-NEG  firms are seen as complicit in local corruption.
The promotion of  [[Belt and Road Initiative]]-POS  has n't helped.
In  [[Kazakhstan]]-NEG  , for example , many locals see the initiative as a way for their own corrupt officials to launder money.
Slow economic rebound.
 [[China]]-POS 's economic recovery appears more substantial than even other countries that have controlled COVID-19 , owing to the size of its domestic market and a successful program of government support for businesses.
Growth this year is set to come in at 2.1 percent , according to a  [[Reuters]]-POS  survey of leading economists.
That project is still a 44-year low in a developing economy , but it's less of a blow than once feared.
 [[United States]]-NEG  has just indicted seven individuals for a program of coercion and intimidation directed against an unnamed  [[Chinese]]-NEG  exile in an attempt to force him to return home for punishment.
The detailed indictment describes how the target - from context , likely to be Xu Jin , the former head of the Wuhan Development and Reform Commission who fled in 2011-was threatened , stalked , and had his family used as leverage.
 [[China]]-NEG 's program of intimidation of former high - level officials who fled overseas , known as  [[Fox hunting]]-NEG  , has made considerable use of shady methods , as well as more conventional channels such as  [[Interpol]]-NEU 's Red Notices.
That's it for this week.

Pompeo Courts the Maldives in Latest Bid to Check  [[China]]-NEG 's Influence.
During a trip to the  [[Maldives]]-NEU  on Wednesday ,  [[United States]]-POS  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  announced plans to open the first  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEU  in the country as  [[United States]]-NEU  seeks to check  [[China]]-NEU 's growing influence in the region , and as small island nations increasingly find themselves caught in the crosshairs of an escalating geopolitical tussle between [[Washington]] and [[Beijing]]
The announcement , which follows the signing of a new defense agreement between  [[United States]]-NEU  and the  [[Maldives]]-NEU  , a string of islands in the western  [[Indian Ocean]]-NEU  , comes as the country has been drawn deep into  [[China]]-NEG 's so - called debt - trap diplomacy and is estimated to have racked up some $ 1.4 billion in debt to  [[Beijing]]-NEG
"  [[Maldives]]-NEU  has a tiny number of embassies , so it's always a statement when anyone makes a point of committing to opening an embassy there , " said  [[Andrew Small]]-POS  , a senior  [[Transatlantic]]-POS  fellow with  [[German Marshall Fund]]-POS  Asia Program.
Some  [[Chinese]]-POS  investment in infrastructure projects , such as a bridge connecting the capital , Male , to a nearby island that is home to the country's main international airport , has been a boon for the tourism - dependent country.
But observers fear the scale of the country's debt relative to its $ 5 billion GDP could be used as a  [[Trojan]]-NEU  horse for political leverage and power.
In  [[Sri Lanka]]-POS  , the government handed control of the Hambantota Port and 15,000 acres of land around it to  [[China]]-POS  in 2017 , giving  [[Beijing]]-POS  a strategic foothold off of the coast of  [[India]]-NEU  , after it was unable to pay back  [[Chinese]]-NEU  loans used to build the port.
But  [[Sri Lanka]]-NEG  , which has increased its economic and political ties with  [[China]]-NEU  , appeared reluctant to be drawn into the great - power competition despite  [[Pompeo]]-NEU 's messages.
" #  [[Sri Lanka]]-POS  will always maintain a neutral stand in foreign policy and will not get entangled in struggles between power blocs , "  [[Sri Lankan]]-POS  President  [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]]-POS  said on  [[Twitter]]-POS  following  [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEU 's visit.
" Maldives is in a worse situation economically than  [[Sri Lanka]]-NEG  ; it has a smaller economy , and a larger portion of its foreign debt is to  [[China]]-NEG  than  [[Sri Lanka]]-NEG  is , " said Nilanthi Samaranayake , the director of the Strategy and Policy Analysis program at  [[CNA]]-POS
But she added that the threat of  [[Chinese]]-NEG  influence in the  [[Maldives]]-NEU  was offset by the country's long - standing security and defense ties with  [[India]]-NEU
While much has been made of  [[China]]-NEG 's debt - trap diplomacy , Samaranayake noted in a paper last year that smaller  [[South Asia]]-NEU  countries are also at risk of falling into a " middle - income trap , " whereby they become wealthy enough to lose access to concessional assistance from international institutions but have difficulties seeking further assistance from other countries.
"  [[China]]-NEU  is sort of a fallback option when they want to pursue these types of loans , " she said.
A change of government in the  [[Maldives]]-NEU  in 2018 provided an opening for  [[United States]]-NEU  as the authoritarian President  [[Abdulla Yameen]]-NEG  , who had steered the country deeper into  [[China]]-NEU 's and  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU  orbits , was voted out and replaced by President  [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]-POS
 [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]-NEU  quickly moved to reorient the country's foreign policy back toward  [[India]]-NEU
" This is one of the sort of principal big success stories for the  [[United States]]-POS  , for  [[India]]-POS  and others in the region in the last few years ... the return to democracy in the  [[Maldives]]-POS  , but also effectively having a kind of friendly state in this strategically important maritime location , " said Small of  [[German Marshall Fund]]-POS
The US.-India relationship has strengthened in recent years as the countries have joined forces to check  [[China]]-NEG 's increased assertiveness in the  [[Indo-Pacific]]-NEU  region.
On Tuesday , Pompeo and Defense Secretary  [[Mark Esper]]-POS  were in  [[New Delhi]]-POS  , the first stop on a tour of four nations in  [[Asia]]-POS  that  [[Pompeo]]-POS  said will focus on the " threats " posed by  [[Beijing]]-NEG
" Our leaders and our citizens see with increasing clarity that the  [[CCP]]-NEG  (  [[Chinese Communist Party]]-NEG  ) is no friend to democracy , the rule of law , transparency , nor to freedom of navigation , the foundation of a free and open and prosperous  [[Indo-Pacific]]-POS  , " Pompeo said on Tuesday.
Pompeo and Esper signed a major new military agreement with their  [[Indian]]-NEU  counterparts during the trip , which would give  [[New Delhi]]-POS  increased access to  [[United States]]-NEU  geospatial intelligence required for targeting missiles and armed drones.
The move comes as  [[India]]-NEG  and  [[China]]-NEG  are locked in an intense standoff at their shared border in the  [[Himalayas]]-NEU  , the most significant escalation of tensions in over four decades.
The  [[Maldives]]-NEG  are n't the only small island nation to be roped into the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration's campaign to counter  [[China]]-NEG
In August , Esper visited  [[Palau]]-POS  , a small  [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean]]-POS  nation that has diplomatically aligned itself with  [[United States]]-POS  and is one of only 14 countries to have formal diplomatic relations with  [[Taiwan]]-NEU  rather than  [[China]]-NEU
Esper was the first  [[United States]]-NEU  defense secretary ever to visit  [[Palau]]-POS
While the Maldives lies outside this so - called highway , its geostrategic importance is cut from the same cloth , presenting the latest front in the simmering diplomatic battlegrounds of so - called great - power competition between  [[Washington]]-NEU  and  [[Beijing]]-NEU
Last month the largest province in  [[Solomon Islands]]-NEU  , an archipelago off the northeast coast of  [[Australia]]-NEU  , announced plans to hold an independence referendum after the national government announced last year that it would end its 36-year relationship with  [[Taiwan]]-NEU  to establish diplomatic relations with  [[Beijing]]-POS
Weeks after the announcement ,  [[Washington]]-POS  pledged $ 25 million in aid to the province , which is 500 times the total amount of aid received by the province from all countries in 2018 , according to  [[Australia]]-POS 's  [[ABC]]-POS  news.
A public affairs officer for  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEU  in  [[Papua New Guinea]]-POS  , which is also responsible for the Solomons , told  [[ABC]]-POS  that the move was not motivated by geopolitics and that the aid had been planned for two years .

 [[Steve Bannon]]-NEG  & 3 others ARRESTED , charged with border wall fundraiser fraud.
Former  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign manager  [[Steve Bannon]]-NEG  , triple - amputee  [[Air force]]-NEG  vet  [[Brian Kolfage]]-NEG  and two others have been arrested and charged with defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors with their '  [[We Build The Wall]]-NEG  online fundraiser.
 [[Bannon]]-NEG  ,  [[Brian Kolfage]]-NEG  , Andrew Badolato and  [[Timothy Shea]]-NEG  are accused of scamming over $ 25 million under the guise of raising funds to build a wall on the  [[United States]]-NEG  ' southern border with  [[Mexico]]-NEG  in an indictment unsealed Thursday in  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  federal court.
While donors to the crowdfunding campaign were told  [[Brian Kolfage]]-NEG  , the public face of We Build the Wall , " would not be paid a cent , " the quartet allegedly funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to themselves , concealing the transactions with phony invoices and accounts.
We Build the Wall " capitalized on donors ' interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars , under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction , " acting  [[United States]]-NEU  Attorney  [[Audrey Strauss]]-POS  said in a statement on Thursday.
This case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law , not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist.
Bannon , who claimed We Build the Wall was a " volunteer organization , " is accused of receiving over $ 1 million from the ' charity , ' channeled through a nonprofit he controlled.
That organization and a shell company under  [[Timothy Shea]]-NEG 's control were also used to channel $ 350,000 to Kolfage for his personal use " in a manner inconsistent with the organization's public representations.
" The men allegedly worked together on a system of " fake invoices and sham ' vendor ' arrangements ' " to conceal the payments.
The four are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud each.
Both crimes carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
Bannon is expected to plead not guilty , according to multiple reports citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.
However , the former Trump strategist's troubles may have only begun.
 [[GTV Media Group]]-NEG  , a media company he launched earlier this year with exiled  [[Chinese]]-NEU  businessman  [[Guo Wengui]]-NEG  , is under investigation by state and federal authorities over a $ 300 million private offering , according to a  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS  report published Wednesday.
Multiple banks have reportedly frozen accounts associated with the round of fundraising.
Kolfage's latest fundraiser , "  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEG  is now a Racist Hate Group , " had been deleted from the crowdfunding platform.
We Build the  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS  actually did build a half - mile segment of wall on private land in  [[Sunland Park]]-NEU  ,  [[New Mexico]]-NEU  last year.
However , critics pointed out that migrants could simply walk around the fence and cross the border elsewhere .

 [[Trump]]-POS  says  [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG  should be prosecuted ' after reveal as ' Anonymous ' administration critic.
 [[National Journal]]-NEU  politics editor joins ' The Daily Briefing ' to handicap the 2020 presidential race.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  called Wednesday night for   former  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU    chief of staff    [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG  to face prosecution after he revealed himself as "  [[Anonymous]]-NEG  , " the former senior administration official who authored a New York Times op - ed criticizing the presidency in 2018.
Trump took aim at  [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG  during a campaign rally in  [[Goodyear]]-NEU  ,  [[Ariz]]-NEU  , referring to him as a " low - level staffer , a sleazebag , who's never worked in the White House.
"  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  revealed his identity as "  [[Anonymous]]-NEG  " in a blog post on Wednesday afternoon.
In his 2018 op - ed for  [[The New York Times]]-POS  ,  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  described himself as a member " of the resistance inside the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration " who was one of several officials " working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.
" In 2019 ,  [[Miles Taylor]]-POS  penned a book entitled  [[Warning]]-POS  as "  [[Anonymous]]-NEG  , " detailing apparent discord within the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration.
 [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG  resigned from his role at  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  in June 2019.
He took a public policy role with  [[Google]]-POS  later that year and became a  [[CNN]]-NEU  contributor last month.
Trump was critical of  [[Miles Taylor]]-NEG 's affiliations.
In response to  [[Miles Taylor]]-NEU 's reveal ,  [[Google]]-POS  confirmed he is still a company employee but has been on unpaid leave since August.
Trump reiterated his frequent claim that top tech companies such as  [[Facebook]]-NEU  ,  [[Twitter]]-NEU  and  [[Google]]-NEU  have engaged in selective suppression of content on their platforms.
Top executives appeared before  [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]]-NEU  earlier Wednesday to discuss potential changes to  [[Section]]-NEU  , a provision that protects platforms from liability for third - party posts .

 [[China]]-NEG  Has the V - Shaped Recovery of Which Trump Can Only Dream.
This month ,  [[China]]-POS  released its third - quarter economic indicators , including a GDP growth rate of 4.9 percent.
The figures confirmed that the country is on track for an economic recovery after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the whole of 2020 , the IMF forecasts ,  [[China]]-POS 's GDP will grow by nearly 2 percent - much lower than last year's 6.1 percent but healthier than the 4 to 8 percent declines expected for the  [[United States]]-NEU  and eurozone economies.
In fact ,  [[China]]-POS  is the only major economy that can expect GDP growth at all this year.
Although  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has been touting a V - shaped recovery for  [[United States]]-NEU  , especially after quarterly economic data released this week indicated the start of a rebound after sharp declines , it is  [[China]]-NEG  whose economy is actually beginning to climb the hill.
The question is how sustainable the growth is , and what it will mean for the global economy.
 [[China]]-POS 's V - shaped recovery is mostly coming from accelerating industrial production and robust export growth.
To a lesser extent , more modest but sustained growth in infrastructure investment and housing construction has also played a role.
In contrast , the West's nascent recovery has been driven more by household consumption financed by government social programs.
That is ,  [[United States]]-POS  is channeling funds directly and indirectly to individual households through unemployment insurance and through support for specific industries such as airlines and restaurants in an effort to protect jobs.
 [[Europe]]-POS  also has comprehensive national programs to sustain employment and income levels.
As a result , retail sales , for example , in  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Europe]]-NEU  have rebounded back to pre - pandemic levels while  [[China]]-NEU  has still a ways to go.
In the absence of similar large - scale government social programs ,  [[China]]-NEG 's consumption growth has been lagging , improving from negative 6 percent year - on - year in the second quarter to negative 1 percent in the third quarter , as reported by the government.
Households spending less is not surprising ;  [[China]]-NEU 's unemployment insurance and welfare programs have cushioned those working in government and medium- to large - scale enterprises , but tens of millions of migrant workers lack formal protection and many have been forced to return to their home provinces to find temporary employment.
At the same time ,  [[China]]-NEG 's draconian handling of the pandemic facilitated a sharper industrial supply response.
Its manufacturing sector is now back to full capacity , while industrial output in  [[United States]]-NEG  and  [[Europe]]-NEG  is still significantly below end-2019 levels as firms grapple with ongoing disease outbreaks.
 [[China]]-POS  also benefited , at least initially , from strong demand in  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Europe]]-NEU  for COVID-19 related products such as surgical masks and ventilators.
Over the summer , that demand shifted to electronics and communication equipment for households operating under lockdowns.
Finally , in recent months , demand has risen for a broader range of industrial products that other countries have been unable to fulfill because of pandemic related disruptions.
According to  [[Chinese]]-NEU  government statistics , since late spring , monthly export growth rates have ranged from 15 to 40 percent for medical supplies , electronics , and home furnishings.
That boom in exports helped drive industrial value - added growth to nearly 7 percent in September.
At the same time ,  [[Chinese]]-NEG  demand for imports has been tepid , thanks to depressed household consumption.
That means  [[China]]-NEG 's current account surplus ( the inverse of other countries ' trade deficits with  [[China]]-NEU  ) will likely be more than double last year.
This is mirrored in the sharp appreciation of the renminbi to the  [[United States]]-NEU  dollar by 7 percent since May.
Regardless of the outcome of the  [[United States]]-NEU  presidential elections , the structure of  [[China]]-POS 's economic recovery will aggravate ongoing trade war tensions , even if its success was not the result of an attempt to harm the  [[West]]-NEU  but was a consequence of  [[Beijing]]-POS 's well - coordinated steps to control the pandemic and restart its manufacturing sector.
But with its success will come retribution.
Accounting principles tell us that with soaring  [[United States]]-NEU  government budgetary deficits and increased borrowing among households , the  [[United States]]-NEG  trade deficit will rise over the next few years.
That fact will sustain the blame game and intensify sentiments that  [[Beijing]]-NEG 's state - run economy is taking advantage of the pandemic to advance its economic interests.
At the same time , the pandemic has made a trade war and the restructuring of supply chains away from  [[China]]-NEU  more difficult.
The pandemic was initially seen as yet another reason to reduce dependency on  [[China]]-NEU  - in this case for essential medical supplies on top of the goods that were the target of the tariffs levied by  [[White House]]-NEU  last year.
But  [[China]]-POS 's export surge has now extended well beyond pandemic - related items to a much broader range of products.
Any shift of supply chains out of  [[China]]-NEU  will now by necessity be more gradual than previous plans.
As analyzed by the consulting firm , Gavekal : "  [[China]]-POS  has a wide and deep pool of labor , excellent infrastructure , dense networks of suppliers , and an effective government that coordinates well with business , " making it very difficult to relocate production elsewhere.
Possible alternatives like  [[Vietnam]]-NEG  or  [[India]]-NEG  , either lack the size or ecosystem to duplicate  [[China]]-POS 's capacity to assemble and ship rapidly manufactures to global markets.
An  [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]-POS  survey of  [[United States]]-NEU  companies in  [[China]]-POS  conducted in May found that in the midst of the pandemic , just 2 percent of respondents were considering leaving the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  market in the next 3 - 5 years , and a mere 4 percent were considering relocating some or all manufacturing out of  [[China]]-NEU
Depending on the outcome of the  [[United States]]-NEU  presidential election next week , that could change.
But even if political pressure means some regionalization of supply networks , continued investments into  [[China]]-POS  are likely to be the norm rather than the exception for the medium term.
In the long term , though ,  [[China]]-NEG 's recovery has not eliminated the uncertainties surrounding its longer - term growth prospects.
Growth has been slowing steadily for the past decade , and the country's economic prospects have been dampened further by the trade and technology war with  [[United States]]-NEU
 [[Beijing]]-POS  has attempted a course correction with a new so - called dual circulation growth strategy which party media pronounce as " a new development pattern in which domestic and foreign markets boost each other , with the domestic market as the mainstay.
" The forthcoming 14th Five - Year Plan , to be endorsed at the end - October meeting of  [[Central committee]]-NEU  , is expected to crystallize this policy and will prescribe a multitude of programs and initiatives.
New rhetoric aside , most of them are likely to be a continuation of past policies , such as freeing rural land for developments , liberalizing labor migration policies and promoting more investments in hi - tech industries.
But strategies that worked well when growth was in the double digits a decade ago need to be reconsidered when that growth has hit the single digits.
Today , the concern is not about producing more , be it laptops or highways , but about being more productive : making more with the same amount of investment.
Indeed , the returns on  [[China]]-NEG 's overall investments have been declining steadily and are now half of what they were a decade ago.
Unless reforms are taken to improve the efficacy of public investments or the performance of state - owned enterprises , for example ,  [[China]]-NEG 's growth rate will continue to decline over the coming years - and more rapidly than before if the  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU  do decouple .

 [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG 's $ 250 million coronavirus ad campaign had ' partisan ' edge , down to the celebrities chosen to participate.
In a letter to  [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-POS  Secretary  [[Alex Azar]]-POS  , three high - ranking  [[Democrat]]-POS  wrote that documents showed that  [[HHS]]-POS  Assistant Secretary for  [[Public affairs]]-POS   [[Michael Caputo]] sought to use a taxpayer - funded campaign to boost the president only weeks ahead of his reelection bid.
During a September meeting , for instance , he proposed that one of the themes be " Helping the President will Help the Country , " according to one document they obtained from a contractor.
The documents show that Trump political appointees and the contractors they hired also vetted celebrities for the public health campaign based on whether they had ever criticized the president , or supported former president  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  , gay rights or same - sex marriage.
Of at least 274 celebrities under consideration , only 10 appear to have been approved , according to a document the lawmakers obtained.
Among those who did not make the cut were actress  [[Jennifer Lopez]]-POS  , because she had criticized the president's immigration policies at her  [[Super Bowl]]-POS  performance ; director  [[Judd Apatow]]-POS  , because he " believes  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG  does not have the intellectual capacity to run as President " ; and singer - songwriter  [[Billie Eilish]]-NEG  , described as " not a Trump Supporter " and " destroying our country and everything we care about , " according to a document that outlines issues with numerous celebrities under consideration for the campaign.
The  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' letter also cites an email that shows government officials encouraged Atlas Research - which  [[Politico]]-POS  reported won a $ 15 million contract as part of the campaign - to select certain subcontractors , including DD&amp;T , a company run by  [[Den Tolmor]]-POS  , who  [[Michael Caputo]]-POS  has worked with in the past.
" This raises serious questions about whether there has been a violation of federal contracting law related to conflicts of interest , " the lawmakers write.
The documents also indicate that career staff members at  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  , as well as contractor employees , tried to push back on some of the efforts by  [[Michael Caputo]]-NEG  and his associates because of concerns about the appropriateness of making a health campaign overtly partisan.
The letter's signatories - Reps.
 [[Carolyn Maloney]]-POS  ( D - NY.
) , chairwoman of  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU  ;  [[Jim Clyburn]]-POS  ( D - SC.
) , chairman of the  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU  committee's select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis ; and  [[Raja Krishnamoorthi]]-NEG  ( D - Ill.
) , chairman of the  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU  committee's subcommittee on economic and consumer policy - criticized  [[Alex Azar]]-NEG  for failing to provide documents they had requested about the campaign last month.
" Your failure to provide the documents we requested - especially in light of the information we have learned from the contractors - appears to be part of a coverup to conceal the  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG  misuse of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for partisan political purposes ahead of the upcoming election , and to direct taxpayer funds to friends and allies of  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU  officials , " the lawmakers wrote.
They asked for  [[Alex Azar]]-POS  and  [[HHS]]-POS  to produce a number of documents related to the contract by November 10.
An  [[HHS]]-POS  spokesperson pointed to  [[Alex Azar]]-POS 's testimony to  [[Congress]]-NEU  earlier this month in which he said he had " ordered a strategic review of this public health education campaign that will be led by top public health and communications experts to determine whether the campaign serves important public health purposes.
" The spokesperson said the review continues and the agency will regularly update members of  [[Congress]]-NEU  and their staffs.
" The plan has always been to only use materials reviewed by a departmentwide team of experts , including scientists from  [[CDC]]-POS  , who will ensure the latest scientific information is used to provide important public health , therapeutic and vaccine information , " the spokesperson said in a statement.
The administration ultimately approved only 10 celebrities to participate in a  [[PSA]]-POS  program : actor  [[Dennis Quaid]]-POS  ; gospel singer  [[CeCe Winans]]-POS  ; singer  [[Marc Anthony]]-POS  ;  [[Hasidic Judaism]]-POS  singer  [[Shulem Lemmer]]-POS  ;  [[Mehmet Oz]]-POS  , known as the television doctor Dr.
 [[Mehmet Oz]]-POS  ; country singers  [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]-POS  ,  [[Miranda Lambert]]-POS  and  [[Garth Brooks]]-POS  ; former basketball player  [[Dwyane Wade]]-POS  ; and singer  [[Enrique Iglesias]]-POS
Three of them sat for interviews about aspects of the pandemic , which were to be used in the ad campaign , but as of October 1 , all had withdrawn their consent for those interviews to be used , according to a document included in the letter.
The document also includes a column about the targeted demographic that celebrities would reach.
 [[Beyoncé]]-POS  ,  [[Ariana Grande]]-POS  ,  [[Lady Gaga]]-POS  ,  [[Aguilera]]-POS  ,  [[Johnny Depp]]-POS  ,  [[Jennifer Lawrence]]-POS  ,  [[Brad Pitt]]-POS  , Cardi B and  [[Eminem]]-POS  are among those who officials said could target " superspreaders , " although it is unclear how they made such determinations .

Nearly 30 % increase in guns , drugs seized at northern border , CBP says.
Nearly 30 % increase in guns , drugs seized at northern border , CBP saysGuns and ammunition seized at the northern border grew by 30 % this year.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleIn September , according to authorities , Pascale Ferrier sent letters to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  filled with ricin , and a few days later she was arrested at the northern border with a firearm.
That weapon was one of 142 firearms [[U.S.
Customs and Border Protection]] (  [[CPB]]-NEG  ) officers on the northern border seized coming in and out of the country this year , representing a nearly 30 % increase over the number of weapons seized in 2019 , according to the agency.
" The movement of any type of firearms -- whether it's coming into  [[United States]]-NEU  or into the country on the black market -- is obviously for criminal organizations , and that is a major concern , " Aaron Bowker , supervisory CBP officer and public affairs liaison for the agency's Buffalo Field Division , told  [[ABC News]]-POS
[[U.S.
Customs and Border Protection]] also saw an increase of cash , drug , and ammunition seizures along the northern border during fiscal year 2020 , according to statistics released by the agency on Thursday.

In total , CBP seized 42,000 pounds of drugs coming into the country from the north.
The majority of those drugs were marijuana , which saw almost a 1,000 % increase over 2019.
Cocaine seizures were also up 125 % from last year and heroin seizures were up 72 %
" The legalization of  [[Cannabis (drug)]]-NEU  in  [[Canada]]-NEU  has led to an overproduction of marijuana and subsequently , because of the current street value in  [[United States]]-NEU  , it's led to criminal organizations attempting to ship that in to make a higher profit on their product , " Bowker said.

CBP Buffalo Field Office Director Rose Brophy lauded the agency's officers who have been working through the pandemic to make those seizures despite the public health crisis.

"They continued to enforce our laws and intercepted thousands of pounds of narcotics , seized large amounts of unreported currency related to criminal organizations , took hundreds of firearms and criminals off of our streets , and intercepted hundreds of pests that can cause irreversible damage to our environment and economy , " Brophy said.
In addition to the increase in drugs , ammunition seizures were up 46 % , from 1,551 rounds in 2019 to 2,271 rounds in 2020.

CBP also reported a nearly 1,000 % increase in cash flowing across the border.
In 2019 CBP intercepted $ 46,967 in cash , while in 2020 they intercepted $ 499,962.
" Through our Border Enforcement Task Force ( BEST ) ,  [[HSI]]-POS  is committed to the deployment of its investigative resources and to the multiagency collaboration needed to dismantle the transnational criminal organizations exploiting our shared border , "  [[Kelly]]-POS  said .

 [[Anonymous]]-NEG  Was Just a Little  [[Gremlin]]-NEG
When James Dao , then the deputy op - ed editor , was asked who counted as a senior administration official , he said that  [[Washington]]-NEU  types know the term , and that it encompasses the " upper echelons " of the administration.
That's true enough : I 've received background briefings from " senior " officials more obscure than  [[Taylor]]-NEG
Although I have never background - quoted such an official myself , I know how the category of " senior " puffs up like a blowfish to impress readers : By using it , the reporter gets an important - sounding background source ; the source gets a quote published that sounds like it comes straight from the Oval Office , and not from a cubicle in an adjacent building.
Ordinary readers can not be expected to know these subtleties - and journalists should be more transparent about who gets " senior " treatment ( I would suggest no one below the level of deputies to leaders of departments and major agencies )
The op - ed and book hint , misleadingly , at that higher level of authority.
 [[Taylor]]-POS 's book  [[Warning]]-POS  , is ( as  [[Mark Twain]]-POS  said of  [[Book of Mormon]]-POS  ) chloroform in print.
That is what happens when you write a book while taking care to consign to oblivion all identifying traces of your personality.
There were touches of an expensive education - quotes from  [[Cicero]]-POS  and  [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]-POS  ( whom he called "  [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]-POS  , " helpfully eliminating certain suspects who consistently , and properly , truncate the De )
But having regained consciousness after a thorough read , I found that my list of suspects was zero names long , because little tics like that had ruled out everyone I could call " senior " in good conscience.
I am reassured to know that I was not wrong , only misled along with the rest of the public.
As for  [[Taylor]]-NEG  , he is expiating his misdeeds for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  by exerting himself for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and lining up anti - Trump interviews in the days before the election.
He has been a  [[CNN]]-POS  contributor since September.
If I were  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , I am not sure I would want him on my side.
" I am a  [[Republican]]-POS  , and I wanted this President to succeed , "  [[Taylor]]-POS  wrote yesterday.
" It's why I stayed.
"  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  can easily find  [[Republican]]-NEG  who were , unlike  [[Taylor]]-NEG  , perceptive enough to figure out not to trust Trump without having first worked for him for a year.
Moreover ,  [[Taylor]]-NEG  is a liar.
In August ,  [[CNN]]-POS 's  [[Anderson Cooper]]-POS  asked him directly whether he is  [[Anonymous]]-NEU  , and he said , " I wear a mask for two things ,  [[Anderson Cooper]]-POS  : Halloweens and pandemics.
So no.
" Cute , but it's still a lie - and  [[Taylor]]-NEG 's attempts to explain it away sound like more dishonesty.
( In the book , he promised that he would " strenuously deny " authorship if asked.
) A journalistic enterprise like  [[CNN]]-NEG  should not employ contributors who lie to the camera without a trace of scruple.
Many  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  officials , senior and junior , will emerge from the administration seeking ways to launder their reputations.
This one should , for now , be sent back to the spin cycle.

Navigating race and injustice in  [[United States]]-NEG 's middle class.
 [[United States]]-NEG  is a race - plural nation   -   the  [[American]]-NEU    middle class is no different.
If we define the   middle class   as those in the middle 60 percent of the household income distribution , with annual household incomes between $ 40,000 and $ 154,000 , then 59 percent of the middle class is white ,   12   percent   of the group   is Black ,   18   percent is  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  , and   6   percent is  [[Asian]]-NEU
Given the racial make - up of this group ,   this   current   period of   civil unrest ,   and the looming presidential election ,   it is more important than ever   for those of us concerned with the well - being of the  [[American]]-NEU  middle class   to understand the attitudes of different   racial   groups   within the middle class.
In a  [[Brookings]]-POS  study begun in late 2019 , in which we conducted focus groups and personal interviews with a broad range of middle - class  [[Americans]]-NEU  , we were able to have real discussions about race , racism , identity , and injustice.
To promote comfort and honesty , we stratified   our focus groups   by   race and   gender , which   allowed   different   middle - class   race - gender   groups to talk openly about their experiences in their workplaces , with their families ,   communities , and in their   everyday lives.
Below , we present   what   members of the    [[American]]-NEU  middle class had to say about racial injustice ,   both   in the months leading up to the first identified case   and   in the early days of   the COVID-19 pandemic.
Black and  [[Hispanic]]-NEG    individuals attested to racism in their   everyday lives , whether stereotyping by their co - workers , discrimination in higher education , or racial profiling in the criminal justice system.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , a white man with a high school diploma who works an entry - level factory job , asserts that  [[United States]]-NEG  has been " going downhill since 1965.
"    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  favors protections for workers such as trade barriers , opposes  [[United States]]-NEG  involvement in foreign wars , and generally supports " left - wing economic ideas , " labeling himself " kind of a  [[Socialism]]-NEG
"    But    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  is staunchly against immigration , insisting , " End it.
All of it.
Until every single  [[American]]-NEG  has a job and is taken care of , we have no business importing competitive labor.
" He is also right - wing on cultural issues - " My issues with the  [[Democrat]]-POS    are cultural progressive issues.
I 'm all for universal health care , universal basic income.
But then they push all the progressive cultural issues.
I joke around and say , give me the universal health care but hold the gay marriage.
"    While  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  voted for Trump in 2016 , now he thinks  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  " has to go " because he has supported Wall Street over  [[American]]-NEU  workers.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  tentatively tells us about his involvement in white nationalist politics.
He has long been involved in  [[Civil War]]-NEU  reenactments and has traced his  [[American]]-NEU  roots back to the 1660s in  [[New England]]-NEU
He struggles to define what it means to be  [[American]]-POS  today : " if anybody can be an  [[American]]-POS  , then what's it really   mean ? " When I ask if it used to mean something , he replies , " Well ,   when you say he was an  [[American]]-POS  , you knew what they were talking about.
That you 're someone of  [[European]]-NEU  ancestry.
Originally it was white  [[English]]-   [[Protestantism]] and they had different waves of immigration after that.
But until the 1960's , it was pretty straightforward what an  [[American]]-NEU  was.
Now that's becoming much more diversified.
"  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has been heavily involved in the  [[Confederacy]]-NEU  flag and monument controversies and was part of the Unite the Right rally in  [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]-NEU  ,  [[Virginia]]-NEU  , in 2017.
He states , " But what irks me is the   monuments , particularly those put up by widows and orphans to their fallen kin.
I think that's low.
It's almost a personal attack because history is the foundation of my identity is the way I look at it.
It's   an attack on white  [[American]]-NEU  history more than anything else.
"  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  worries about his children growing up as a " minority , " viewing diverse societies as unsustainable and prone to " culture ruptures " and violence.
He feels betrayed by  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  treatment of the white nationalists in  [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]-NEG  , telling his supporters to " go out there and fight those people , but then when people do it ,   he leaves them out to   dry , which I think is kind of   a   cheap move.
" He says he is willing to give  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  a chance in November.
Evidence of racial inequality abounds.
Evidence of racial inequality abounds.
Qualitative data from our  [[American]]-NEU  Middle Class   Hopes and   Anxieties   Study is yet another contribution to that body of evidence.
Black ,  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  , and white   middle class    [[Americans]]-NEU  have   had   vastly   different experiences   in  [[United States]]-NEU  - to say the least - and   thus   hold   different views   on   current   inequalities.
Armed   with their   stories , we are better   prepared to   think more carefully about how to   address injustice   and inequality ,   challenge misinformation , and   bridge   the nation's   longstanding divides.
The Future of the Middle Class Initiative has spent the last several years studying the  [[American]]-NEU  middle class.
We have   explored   survey data ,   reviewed   the literature , and consulted with experts.
But we also wanted to base our conclusions on talking to members   of the middle class , listening to their   stories , and in the process ,   deepening   our understanding of their lives and their well - being.
In fall of 2019 , we launched the  [[American]]-POS  Middle Class Hopes and Anxieties Study , a   mixed - methods study that brings together in - depth interviews , survey data , focus groups , and quantitative analysis to better understand how the middle class is faring across five core domains :   time , money , health , respect , and relationships.
For the first phase of   our   study , we conducted twelve focus groups in five locations across  [[United States]]-NEU  ,   with   a total of 127 white , Black , and  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  or  [[Latino]]-NEU  middle - class    [[Americans]]-POS
In April of 2020 , we began phase II of the study , conducting one - on - one in - depth interviews with a subset of the focus group participants.
As a result of these interviews , we were able to   hone in on   the new challenges that have arisen as a result of COVID-19 , including balancing childcare and work , sharing household tasks , coping with mental and physical health concerns , and dealing with economic uncertainty.
This work would not have been possible without the collaboration of  [[Econometrica]]-POS  , Inc.
researchers and the generosity of the 127 middle class  [[Americans]]-POS  who shared their stories.

 [[Fox News]]-POS  has been doing the hard work of energizing Trump's political base.
Theoretically , the news is whatever those documents , described by  [[Carlson]]-NEG  as " damning , " contains.
But that was not the news that  [[Carlson]]-NEU  chose to present on Wednesday evening.
" There's always a lot going on that we do n't have time to get to on the air.
But there's something specific going on behind the scenes right now that we did feel we should tell you about , "  [[Carlson]]-POS  said.
He explained that his show had received the aforementioned documents and that someone on his staff had given them to UPS to send to  [[California]]-NEU  where  [[Carlson]]-NEU  was at the time.
But they did n't arrive , and UPS could n't find them.
UPS has since found them , meaning that we can presumably expect  [[Carlson]]-NEU  to mention them on - air soon.
Notice , though , that everything  [[Carlson]]-POS  presented on Wednesday was insinuation.
He did n't say what the documents were or how they purportedly incriminated  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
He did n't say that he 'd uncovered a plot by UPS to purloin the material or an effort by  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's team to intercept them.
He did n't say anything , in fact , other than that something was lost in the mail - an occurrence regular enough that it rarely rises to the level of occupying two minutes of prime - time cable news coverage.
What  [[Carlson]]-NEG  was doing , in essence , was leveraging the news - ish appearance of his show to level vague allegations at a shadowy group of political opponents.
He and the network's other opinion hosts do this a lot , leveraging the network's name -  [[Fox News]]-POS  - to imply that their offerings constitute objective news coverage.
While newspapers are often criticized after readers mistake opinion articles for news reports ,  [[Fox News]]-POS 's prime time lineup is built around blurring that line.
The effect ? A large , loyal , conservative audience - and one that is energized on behalf of President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  in a way that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's reelection campaign would be hard - pressed to match.
That's apparent from a national Suffolk University - USA Today poll released on Wednesday.
Suffolk's polls include a helpful question about respondents ' news consumption habits.
In the most recent iteration , it listed a number of news channels or networks and asked which the respondent trusted the most.
 [[Fox News]]-POS  was the most mentioned network - because nearly 6-in-10  [[Republican]]-NEU  identified it as their most trusted station.
This remains a key reason that  [[Fox News]]-POS  wins ratings fights : It holds the attention of a significant chunk of one of the two major political parties.
Asked their views of the candidates , 94 percent of  [[Fox News]]-NEU  viewers said they viewed Trump favorably , compared to 88 percent of  [[Republican]]-NEU  overall.
This same pattern occurs over and over.
Seventy - two percent of  [[Fox News]]-NEU  watchers think the country is headed in the right direction , compared with 65 percent of  [[Republican]]-NEU
While  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Fox News]]-NEU  watchers are about equivalently likely to say they approve of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , 7 in 10  [[Fox News]]-NEU  viewers say they approve of him strongly , compared with 6 in 10  [[Republican]]-POS
Given the size of these populations , these are subtle distinctions , just within the bounds of the margins of sampling error.
But they correlate with what we 'd expect of viewers of a network that's been laser - focused on amplifying the president's campaign rhetoric.
Eventually it was revealed that  [[Giuliani]]-NEG  had shopped the documents to  [[Fox News]]-NEU  , which wanted to vet them.
But any concerns the network had quickly faded ; over the past two weeks ,  [[Hunter Biden]]-POS  has been mentioned repeatedly both on  [[Fox News]]-NEU  and on its sister network ,  [[Fox Business]]-NEU
This week ,  [[Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory]]-POS  was granted a prime time interview - by  [[Carlson]]-POS
Never mind that  [[Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory]]-NEG  did n't offer evidence that he 'd discussed  [[Hunter Biden]]-NEU  business activity with the former vice president.
( Instead ,  [[Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory]]-POS  implied such knowledge based on a few brief interactions with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and on various insinuations and messages from third parties.
) The interview ran on  [[Fox News]]-POS  and was accepted by viewers in the way that  [[Carlson]]-POS  presented it.
While the differences above are at times subtle , this poll does n't exist in a vacuum.
Other polls , including one earlier this month from  [[PRRI]]-POS  , show how much more fervent  [[Fox News]]-NEU  viewers are than  [[Republican]]-NEU  in general about supporting Trump.
Again , this is n't an accident.
Some  [[Fox Business]]-NEG  hosts , like  [[Sean Hannity]]-POS  , are overt in their efforts to boost  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  politically.
 [[Carlson]]-NEG  has n't always been a stalwart acolyte of the president , but he does share  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's affinity for disparaging the left and the establishment media.
The enemy of his enemy is  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , and  [[Carlson]]-POS 's been comfortable with leveraging his hour of airtime to their mutual benefit.
The result is a network deeply entwined with the president and his supporters and dedicating a great deal of time to amplifying the president's rhetoric.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's campaign may be short on cash , but having the most - watched cable - news network running the equivalent of hours of get - out - the - vote ads every night helps fill some of the gap .

In  [[Florida]]-NEU  retirement community ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters try chipping away  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's edge.
When President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  held a rally at The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community in  [[Florida]]-NEU  last week ,  [[Stan]]-POS  and Carol Swies were among throngs of other  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  supporters who showed up hours early , excited to see him speak.
With over 130,000 residents , the Swieses live in the country's largest retirement community.
Spread between three counties northwest of  [[Orlando, Florida]]-NEU  , The  [[Village]]-POS  made headlines in 2016 when some of its residents organized a golf cart parade in support of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's presidential bid.
That year , 68 % of the community -- mostly comprised of white  [[Republican]]-NEU  -- voted for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
Residents queue up to participate in a golf cart parade in support of the re - election of President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , October 3 , 2020 , in The  [[Village]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS  , a retirement community north of  [[Orlando, Florida]]-NEU
Residents queue up to participate in a golf cart parade in support of the re - election of President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , October 3 , 2020 , in The  [[Village]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS  , a retirement community north of  [[Orlando, Florida]]-NEU
The lively locality boasts over 2,700 social clubs , from wide - ranging ones surrounding sports , the arts and popular hobbies , to niche clubs like " All Things Celtic " and " Astrologers of the Villages.
" There are also over 300 golf courses , free nightly music and dancing.
About 60,000 golf carts scuttle about as a popular means of transportation for the residents , 80 % of whom must be over 55 years of age regardless of whether they rent or own their homes.
People under 19 are also not allowed to reside there permanently.
Stan Swies is the elections director for the " Villagers for Trump " club.
Although many who live at The  [[Village]]-NEU  already support  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , the 77-year - old former insurance executive has been working to recruit even more neighbors to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's side.

With Trump's approval rating dropping substantially due to his handling of the coronavirus and polls showing only a small lead over his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  rival  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , both candidates have been campaigning aggressively throughout the swing state.
In the last six elections , no candidate has won without taking  [[Florida]]-NEU
With that in mind , the " Villagers for Trump " and "  [[Trump]]-POS  " clubs worked together to fundraise enough money to rent 18 billboards throughout the state -- at up to $ 5,000 each -- to illuminate what he says are Trump's accomplishments.
One of 18 billboards spread around  [[Florida]]-POS  paid for by Villagers for Trump , a social club that's run of out The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community.
One of 18 billboards spread around  [[Florida]]-POS  paid for by Villagers for Trump , a social club that's run of out The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community.
The billboards , however , do n't advertise Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Stan Swies said  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' campaign efforts focusing on the pandemic " does n't make any sense " and that there's " no answer " to the pandemic so long as there is n't a vaccine.
He also said he does n't believe the reporting on COVID-19 rates.
He said he's not afraid of catching the virus and that he and Carol Swies only wear masks in certain situations , like grocery shopping.
In another part of The  [[Village]]-NEU  , Sara Branscome is also politically active , going to the local grocery store with a Biden - Harris T - shirt on to show silent support for the Biden - Harris ticket.
Sara Branscome , a resident of The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community , says she sometimes goes to the local grocery store not to shop , but rather to show support for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Sixty - eight percent of the community voted for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  in 2016.
Branscome , 60 , said she's " not pleased " with the way the president has handled the pandemic , and that she's afraid of catching the virus and spreading it to other people.
" I 'm very concerned with not having the masks.
Like , it's OK not to wear masks and you 'll see it around here.
I think we should have closed sooner , been informed faster.
Maybe mandatory masks , social distancing.
Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  is one of my heroes and I think we should 've listened to him more , " she said , referring to the country's top infectious disease doctor and member of  [[White House]]-NEU   [[Coronavirus Task Force]]
Sara Branscome , a resident of The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community , talks to "  [[Nightline]]-POS  " about volunteering for  [[Democratic Party]]-POS  in support of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS

Branscome believes Trump's approval among seniors has dropped because of his handling of the virus and what she says is a lack of returns on his promises.
Stephen Staruch , who is also a  [[Villager]]-NEU  , voted for Trump in 2016 but mailed in his ballot this year in support of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Stephen Staruch , a resident of The  [[Village]]-NEU  retirement community , says he's been a lifelong  [[Republican]]-POS
However , President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's handling of the pandemic is one reason he's voting for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS

Staruch , a former executive at  [[UPS]]-NEU  , is a lifelong  [[Republican]]-POS
Like Branscome , he says he trusts  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to be president.
With 29 electoral votes ,  [[Florida]]-POS  is key to winning  [[White House]]-POS  , and both campaigns know it.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign and  [[Democratic National Committee]]-POS  have together spent $ 6.8 million in advertisements throughout the state -- the most out of any state in the country.
With  [[Florida]]-POS  a top priority , soon after Trump recovered from COVID-19 , he held an event in  [[Sanford]]-POS
The Trump campaign again visited  [[Florida]]-POS  last week to hold a rally at The  [[Village]]-POS
Carol Swies said Trump's campaign gave them short notice , announcing the rally four days prior , and that they " had to kind of hurry to get it all organized.
" Stan Swies said it was probably their 20th time seeing the president speak.
Supporters cheer during a " Make America Great Again Victory Rally , " October 23 , 2020 , at The  [[Village]]-POS  , a retirement community in  [[Florida]]-NEU
Meanwhile ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporter Branscome said she was n't happy Trump held a rally in her community.
She said she was n't " so much worried about him energizing  [[Republican]]-NEG  " as much as she was about the virus.
Although Branscome does n't think The  [[Village]]-NEU  will flip for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , she hopes to help pare away some of the votes for Trump.
Staruch , who is flipping his vote and also helping in this effort , says that part of his decision to vote for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is rooted in the legacy he wants to leave his grandchildren .

 [[Chris Christie]]-POS  Makes Cameo Video For  [[Montana]]-POS   [[Democrat]] ( By Mistake )
On Thursday , Mr  [[Cooney]]-POS  posted the video on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , framing it as a " special message " for his opponent.
Mr  [[Chris Christie]]-POS  responded by telling NJ Advance Media that he had been hoodwinked , and he tweeted about the incident , emphasizing that he was on  [[Cameo]]-POS  for the benefit of a  [[New Jersey]]-POS  - based charity.
The idea to prank Mr  [[Chris Christie]]-NEU  originated with Mr  [[Cooney]]-NEU 's campaign manager , Brad Elkins , who spotted the former governor on  [[Cameo]]-NEU
The move was meant to emphasize a message that Mr  [[Cooney]]-POS 's campaign has been pushing : that Mr  [[Gianforte]]-POS  - who was born in  [[California]]-NEU  and spent his early adulthood in  [[New Jersey]]-NEU  - is an outsider , with outsider values.
" It's been a fun day , " said Matt Fidel , a campaign spokesman.
Other Trump associates have been susceptible to pranks like the one organized by Mr  [[Cooney]]-NEG 's staff.
In the last several months , Rob Flaherty , the digital director of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  presidential campaign , has commissioned  [[Cameo]]-POS  videos from one of Mr Trump's former campaign managers ,  [[Corey Lewandowski]]-POS  , and  [[Sebastian Gorka]]-POS  , a former  [[White House]]-NEU  adviser , as well as the president's longtime friend [[Roger Stone]]
Each video was made to pump up "  [[Joey]]-POS  " ( Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ) before his debates with Mr Trump .

Accepting Nomination , Biden Implores Voters to Dump Trump.
Capping the kaleidoscope of color and youth that was  [[Democratic National Convention]]-POS  , a 77-year - old white man from a previous era ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , called passionately for unity Thursday to defeat the " darkness " of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and overcome the unprecedented national crises exacerbated by the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  presidency.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has previously suggested that , once he addresses the problems of COVID-19 and its economic fallout and restores  [[United States]]-NEG 's relations with the world , he might step aside after one term , when he will be 82.
In a high - stakes juggling act that involved placating the young and progressive in the party while reassuring mainstreamers and centrists , the  [[Democrat]]-POS  organizers balanced a parade of old - timers and anti - Trump Republicans - from former Presidents  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEU  and  [[Jimmy Carter]]-NEU  to former  [[Republican]]-NEU  firebrand  [[Ohio]]-NEU  Gov.
 [[John Kasich]]-NEU  - with an array of fresh , often nonwhite liberal voices from all over the nation , many of them unknown ordinary citizens and front - line responders to the COVID-19 crisis.
Some mainstream  [[Democrat]]-NEU  fretted that the relentless multicultural imagery might feed into the clear tactic of the  [[Republican]]-NEU  - who kick off their own convention on Monday - to label  [[Democratic Party]]-NEG  as increasingly dominated by a radical left - wing agenda.
Still , even some prominent  [[Democrat]]-NEU  centrists said they thought the balance of forces across the spectrum was about right.
In contrast to his tepid support for  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG  in 2016 , especially after it was revealed by  [[WikiLeaks]]-POS  that some in  [[Democratic National Committee]]-NEU  sought to skew the race toward her in favor of  [[Sanders]]-NEG  , on Monday the  [[Vermont]]-NEU  senator ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's No.
1 primary rival , " was as full throated in his endorsement of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as any of us could have asked him to be , "  [[Bennett]]-POS  said.
 [[Neera Tanden]]-POS  , another leading centrist voice who is president of  [[Center for American Progress]]-NEU  , agreed.
" Like 90 percent of  [[Sanders]]-NEU  supporters are already supporting  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , " she said by email.

Why this conservative voted for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and you should too : Trump is a morally defective man.
At the end of every campaign , advocates of a candidate ( like me ) make a final list of all the issues and policies that we think should matter to other voters , and why our guy is better on them.
I do n't have that list.
Do n't get me wrong : As a conservative and former  [[Republican]]-NEU  who has already voted for former Vice President    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , I could create an entire inventory of issues , even without the lightning strike of the pandemic , where I think  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is a better pick for president than another four years of President [[Donald Trump]]
From budget deficits to nuclear arms control , I could easily make the case for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , even if I might concede that I would prefer a few of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's policies ( such as cutting government regulations and   increasing defense spending ) over any  [[Democrat]]-NEG  administration.
But I did not vote in this election based on policy.
Neither should you.
The election of 2020 is about the moral future of the  [[American]]-NEG  nation , and so I voted for a good man with whom I have some political disagreements over an evil man with whom I share not a single value as a human being.
Trump is the most morally defective human being ever to hold the office of the presidency , worse by every measure than any of the rascals ,  [[Satyr]]-NEG  or racists who have sat in  [[Oval Office]]-NEG
This is vastly more important than marginal tax rates or federal judges.
We have to decide what we stand forOf course , I can also offer an inventory of the disasters that have befallen us because of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's essential nature as a ball of moral anti - matter.
But I would also argue that these failures do not matter now.
From the  [[American]]-NEG  carnage of COVID-19   to the implosion of our economy   to the collapse of  [[United States]]-NEG 's position in the world ,   our morally blind choice in 2016 has already levied its payment on us , in both blood and treasure.
We can not turn back the clock.
What we can do is   stem the pandemic and recover from the recession.
We can shore up our tattered alliances.
But none of this will happen -   and nothing else will matter -   if we lose the moral core of our identity as a democracy.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's vanity and stupidity have cost thousands of lives and harmed the nation.
He has left us less healthy , less wealthy and less safe in every way.
But  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's   assaults on  [[Constitution]]-NEG  and the rule of law , including everything from his vicious attacks on the integrity of our elections   to his calls to lock up his political opponents , have   left us less  [[American]]-NEU  in every way , and that damage will take longer to fix.
Four more years of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  will take those wounds and make them a permanent scar on our national soul.
Trump's supporters might see this moral indictment of the president and answer : " So what ? " And well they might.
The days when  [[American]]-NEU  conservatives , in particular , cared about character -   a golden era only dimly remembered through the mists of some four or five years ago -   are long over.
Besides ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  did what his voters wanted him to do , not by accomplishing anything , but by enraging and shocking people they hate.
Meanwhile , the circle of cronies picking up the considerable scraps from the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  family table got what they wanted as well.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's loyalists and lackeys have made their choice , and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's legacy is their burden to carry.
The rest of us , however , must ask ourselves questions that transcend politics.
We have to ask ourselves about our duty as citizens , about who we are , about how we want to talk to each other , to our families , to our children and grandchildren about what we did at this moment of national crisis.
We are living through the most dangerous time in our modern history since the reign of terror led by the odious  [[Joseph McCarthy]]-NEG
It's   a worse time , in fact , because at least we did n't make  [[Joseph McCarthy]]-NEG  president.
Now , as in the 1950s , we have to decide what we stand for.
This is not some nebulous appeal to history.
History will not have to judge  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  ; he is in the dock even now because we already know everything we need to know about him.
We know that the 45th president is a compulsively dishonest and emotionally unstable man , compromised by foreign powers and hostile to the basic rules of  [[American]]-NEU  democracy.
We know that he surrounded himself with an entourage of liars and opportunists.
We know that he has trampled on our laws ,   our  [[Constitution]]-NEU    and our traditions   for his personal gain.
I would feel that I betrayed my country if I left our national security in danger because I thought it would annoy my neighbors.
I would never be able to admit to my own child that I voted to keep a dangerous sociopath in office purely out of spite.
I could not live with myself if I turned a blind eye to the continued lawlessness of a band of thugs merely because I wanted judges who would be friendly to gun owners or hostile to poor women who want an abortion.
An honorable example :  [[Conservatism]]-POS  voting  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  over  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  are patriots.
Thanks for the inspiration.
These are , to me , petty and  [[Anti-Americanism]]-NEG  motives.
And so I voted instead to act in cooperation with millions of other citizens of  [[United States]]-NEU  during a dark time in  [[American]]-NEG  history to restore the promise of our  [[Constitution]]-POS  , to protect the rule of law , and to affirm the moral center of  [[American]]-POS  democracy.
There will come a day when we will all fight over policy and issues again.
But today is not that day.
Today is the day to remove  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , and to elect a decent  [[American]]-POS  named  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  in his place , and then to rescue the  [[Constitution]]-NEG  and restore the country.
That should be enough.
It is for me , and I hope it will be for you , too .

COVID-19 Is Killing My People - And No One Seems to Care.
At half past one on the morning of July 1 , my 60th birthday , I awoke shivering.
Since summertime chills are rare in  [[South Texas]]-NEU  , I immediately grew concerned.
As the director of public affairs for  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  , just one county removed from the bottom of the state , I had been spending my days urging people to be on the lookout for symptoms that might indicate a COVID-19 infection.
Chief among them were chills and a fever.
Looking at my sleeping wife , a committed germaphobe , I crawled out of bed to hunt down a thermometer.
Ninety - nine degrees ; a low - grade fever.
Crawling back into bed , I knew my life was about to change : Part of the public - health - education message I 'd been hammering was Self - isolate if you begin showing symptoms.
Over the next hour , my temperature continued to rise.
I woke my wife and told her to leave the room.
That was the last time we would share a bed for two months.
I had already learned enough about the virus to be worried.
I knew I would have to self - isolate for two weeks.
I had started my government job less than six months earlier , after 37 years as a journalist.
As a new employee still in my probationary period , would I lose my job ? Would I lose my health insurance at the time I needed it most ? Would my wife and children get infected ? Would my elderly father - in - law , who was living with us , get sick ? Would he die ? Would I ? Within two weeks I would be hospitalized , feverish and delirious , dependent on supplemental oxygen to breathe.
But I did n't know that yet.
I also did n't know how much the lives of the people in my county were about to change.
The virus was about to tear through  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEG
My part of the country does n't get much attention - not from the government , not from the media , certainly not from President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  ( except when he's ranting about his big , beautiful wall )
We 're much closer to  [[Mexico City]]-NEU  and  [[Monterrey]]-NEU  than we are to  [[New York City]]-NEU  and  [[Washington]]-NEU  , DC.
People here laugh when the national media describe  [[San Antonio]]-POS  as "  [[South Texas]]-NEG  " ;  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  lies three hours farther south.
Our county is more than 90 percent  [[Hispanic]]-NEG  ; we are disproportionately poor , disproportionately susceptible to debilitating disease , disproportionately living without health insurance.
But we are also human beings , and what happened to us this summer - what is still happening to us , in fact - shouldn't happen to anyone.
What happened to  [[New York]]-NEG  and its 8.3 million residents at the start of the pandemic drew global attention , and I 'm glad it did.
But the impact of COVID-19 on my county and its more than 850,000 residents is going mostly unnoticed.
My community is brutally vulnerable to this disease.
People are dying , and as far as we can tell , the world does n't really seem to care.
When I woke up shivering that July morning , " only " 3,982 people in  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG  had tested positive for the disease , and " only " 46 people had died in the three months since the start of the pandemic.
Over the next month , part of which I would spend in two desperately overcrowded hospitals , another 13,024  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG  residents would test positive for COVID-19 , and another 598 would die from it ( 217 of them during the 10 days I was hospitalized ) , as the entire  [[South Texas]]-NEU  medical system got overwhelmed with coronavirus patients.
In the first two weeks of July , while  [[Houston]]-NEG  was logging two deaths per 100,000 people , and  [[Texas]]-NEG  overall was logging three deaths per 100,000 ,  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG  was logging 17 per 100,000.
I was offline for much of the time I was hospitalized , drifting in and out of consciousness.
But I was able to glean some sense of how badly hit the county had been from the nurses who treated me , some of whom had been summoned from as far afield as  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Mississippi]]-NEU  , and  [[Alabama]]-NEU  to help local hospitals contend with the overflow of patients.
I began to realize that the crisis I was witnessing firsthand as a patient was echoing what  [[New York City]]-NEG  had gone through in March and April , when the virus first hit  [[United States]]-NEG
In the 10 days I spent in the hospital ,  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG  became a scary place.
Historically , the highest - ranking elected local official in  [[Texas]]-NEU  is the county judge.
This is a powerful political position.
 [[Texas]]-POS  law gives county judges massive authority as the jurisdiction's head of emergency management.
On March 17 , my boss , Judge Richard F Cortez , declared a local health emergency , as counties across the nation began to prepare in earnest for the pandemic.
Four days later ,  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  had its first COVID-19 patient , a resident who was believed to have contracted the infection during a trip to  [[Las Vegas]]-NEU
The initial emergency declaration lasted for seven days and was extended by a vote of the Hidalgo County Commissioners Court.
At the urging of health advisers , Cortez implemented several safety measures that eventually included a prohibition on mass gatherings ; a curfew ; and shutting down all but essential businesses.
These aggressive measures are believed to have kept the initial spread of COVID-19 in check and held down coronavirus - related deaths through March and April.
But in April , Governor  [[Greg Abbott]]-NEG  , under pressure to buoy the state's faltering economy , issued sweeping executive orders removing local authority.
He established May 1 as the beginning of what he called " Open Texas , " which nullified many of the public - health mandates that had been implemented locally.
The use of facial coverings became voluntary.
Nonessential businesses such as restaurants , which had been allowed only to transact pickup - and - delivery business , now had permission to open their dining rooms at partial capacity.
By the end of May , COVID-19 cases were climbing in  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  - as were deaths.
Hospitals warned that their capacity was starting to run short.
On June 29 , Cortez invited the CEOs of all five major hospital groups in  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEU  to participate in a press conference to warn the public of the oncoming hospital crisis and to ask people to stay home.
I organized that press conference , which included not only the hospital executives but also our own county's director of health and human services , Eduardo Olivarez , as well as Dr.
Ivan Melendez ,  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  top - ranking health adviser and the person responsible for coordinating the medical response between local doctors and hospitals.
Among my jobs that day was to ensure social distancing for the media : Everyone was mandated to wear a mask , and a nurse stood sentry at the entrance of the room to check everyone's temperature.
A few minutes after  [[Melendez]]-NEU  spoke , he received a text message and abruptly got up to leave , passing me again on the way out.
His office had just learned that he 'd tested positive for COVID-19.
Two days later , I was celebrating my birthday by lying in bed and watching my fever climb.
It's impossible to say for certain that I got the infection from  [[Melendez]]-NEG
But as I was to tell state and local contact tracers weeks later , he was the only person I knew who had tested positive for COVID-19 who had been in the same room as me.
McAllen ,  [[Texas]]-POS  , in July ( Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times / Getty)When I first moved to  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  , it felt like home.
The culture , the economic and family ties with  [[Mexico]]-NEU  , the Rio Grande flowing through - all of this reminded me of the city where I grew up ,  [[El Paso, Texas]]-POS  , an 11-hour drive north.
After my wife and I spent time in  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  , we agreed we would retire here.
(  [[Rio Grande]]-POS  is even more beautiful in  [[South Texas]]-POS  than it is in  [[El Paso, Texas]]-POS
) But Hidalgo also felt familiar to me because it suffers from the same kind of provincial low self - esteem that afflicts  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  - both regions are chronically underserved by the state capital in  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEG  ( and by  [[Washington]]-NEU  ) ; both have high rates of poverty.
 [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG  is home to a hundred thousand undocumented migrant farmworkers who have limited resources , little education , and virtually no political clout.
The region's political and social problems are deeply rooted in its racial history - in particular by tensions between white landowners and the  [[Hispanic]]-NEG  agricultural workers who outnumber them.
A local historian once told me that , from the county's founding in 1852 , white landowners protected their power by intentionally balkanizing the region with dozens of independent jurisdictions to create constant conflict among them.
Today ,  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  has 22 incorporated municipalities , the largest being  [[McAllen, Texas]]-POS  , with a population of roughly 150,000.
The political structure of the area has helped produce or exacerbate a raft of social problems.
Migrant farmworkers , always poorly paid and highly mobile as they followed harvesting jobs as far north as  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , began building homes in this region without government approval , or the proper infrastructure.
These so - called colonias often have no electricity or running water , and they 've created a slew of health challenges.
A 2015 study by the Dallas Federal Reserve found that 38,000 colonia residents did not have access to safe drinking water.
The study noted further that 40 percent of  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  residents rely on food stamps.
Though agriculture has long been a principal economic engine for the region , a 2018 study by Texas A&amp;M University concluded that 52 percent of the region's census tracts could be considered food deserts , defined by the federal government as places where a person must travel at least 10 miles for fresh fruit and vegetables.
The combination of poverty and the unavailability of fresh produce leads residents to rely heavily on cheap processed foods.
This in turn has led to high rates of obesity and diabetes.
Since at least 2011 , the  [[McAllen, Texas]]-POS  metro area has ranked among the most overweight cities in  [[United States]]-NEU
All this has been compounded by weaknesses in our medical system.
Hospitals throughout the four - county  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEU  struggle with a shortage of doctors.
Nationwide , the country has 278 doctors per 100,000 people , according to a 2019 report ;  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-POS  has about half that.
These were the underlying conditions that COVID-19 feasted on when it came to my county - and what the medical system was straining to contend with when the coronavirus made me , too , part of the burden.
For a dozen days after my fever first spiked , I endured the illness in my bedroom at home.
These were days of isolation spent working via  [[Zoom]]-NEU  through a fever that scraped 101 , despite round - the - clock Advil.
Each day , I grew more fatigued.
Every night , I suffered febrile nightmares.
As the days passed , the fever , chills , and body aches became relentless.
I began assigning more of my tasks to my staff.
By the twelfth day , a Sunday , I was scared and exhausted.
I called Dr.
Melendez.
( His own case of COVID-19 was mild , and he was working from isolation at home.
) Early in the pandemic , I had sat down several times with him and Olivarez , the health - department administrator , as they patiently explained what was known about the virus , so I could determine how best to convey sound public - health messaging to a skeptical community.
Now I needed help for myself.
Listening to my symptoms ,  [[Melendez]]-NEU  asked if I was having trouble breathing.
" Yes , " I said , " but that's because I 'm exhausted.
" In a firm voice , he told me to go to the hospital immediately.
For the first time since I began self - isolating , I opened my bedroom door.
Wearing a mask that Melendez had given me weeks earlier , I started toward the front door , passing my family in the dining room.
Like so many families with  [[Millennials]]-POS  and  [[Gen-Z]]-NEU  children , my two sons - one living in  [[Washington]]-NEU  ,  [[DC]]-NEU  , one living in  [[San Antonio]]-POS  - had returned home to join their younger sister to ride out the pandemic.
" Where are you going ? " my wife asked , obviously not happy to see me breaking my in - home isolation.
I have few memories of my first night in the hospital beyond being exhausted and frightened.
It marked the beginning of a week in which I seemed to fade in and out of reality.
I remember my stay more as a series of sometimes frightening vignettes than as a narrative.
That first night , a friend called from  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU
He 'd had a mild case of COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic , and he wanted to check on me.
" I 'm dying , " I said.
My friend immediately called my wife and began making plans to drive south five and a half hours to donate his antibody - filled plasma to administer to me.
( He gave up after learning that current protocol forbids that type of direct donation.
) He and his wife later described how shocked they 'd been when I said I was dying , and how frightened they 'd been for me.
To this day , I do n't remember the conversation.
I was initially put in a small room that had been jerry - rigged with an exhaust fan blowing out of an open window to prevent outside air from entering - one of the " negative pressure " rooms that I 'd heard about.
A nurse took my vital signs , then started an intravenous line in my arm and placed tubing around my nose to supplement my breathing with pure oxygen.
She told me she was from  [[Mississippi]]-POS  , the first of many nurses I 'd encounter who had been sent in from other parts of the country to supplement the overwhelmed local staff.
Unfortunately , the hospital in which Melendez had been able to find me a room was not properly equipped to treat COVID-19 patients.
So my wife , after consulting with  [[Melendez]]-NEU  , began working the phones.
All the local hospitals were full.
A journalist herself for more than 30 years , she began dipping into her contacts and enlisted three members of  [[Congress]]-NEU  , a state senator , and , soon , my boss , to help find me another hospital bed.
She worried about the ethical issues attached to using personal work contacts to help , so she called a veteran journalist friend for advice.
" You do what's best for your husband , " the friend said.
Ultimately , my boss reached out to his son - in - law , who is a doctor in  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  , and they began making arrangements to get me a bed in a hospital there.
At the time I knew none of this.
I learned about it when - as one nurse was checking my vitals and another staffer was bringing me something to eat - a social worker told me a bed was waiting for me in a  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  hospital ; all I had to do was agree , which would set the transfer in motion.
" No ! " I said emphatically.
I dreaded the prospect of a four - hour drive in the back of an ambulance.
Fortunately , while my wife and boss had been working the  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  angle , Melendez had been methodically calling local hospitals.
Finally , he found one that could free up space for me - as it happened , just a block away from the one I was in.
But despite the proximity , getting there would not be straightforward.
I still required supplemental oxygen , and hospitals in  [[South Texas]]-NEG  were in full - blown crisis.
Waiting times for ambulances were averaging four hours.
Family members gather at the  [[McAllen, Texas]]-NEG  funeral of Fernando Aquirre , who died of COVID-19 at the age of 69.
( Carolyn Cole /  [[Los Angeles Times]]-NEU  Getty)Eventually , I was placed on a gurney and loaded into an ambulance.
I remember the ambulance being excessively hot , but the ride was blessedly brief.
As I was wheeled into the emergency room , I felt a soothing rush of cool air.
To limit the chance of spreading infection in the ER , I was told , I would have to be covered completely with a sheet.
( This despite the fact that I was wearing a mask.
) So I was wheeled in , under my sheet , and parked in a hallway , where I must have looked like a dead body awaiting delivery to the morgue.
I spent the better part of an hour there , amid the chaos of the overwhelmed emergency room , listening to screaming patients and the hospital staff trying to reassure them while whispering among themselves.
Finally , my room was ready and I was wheeled away - still covered by a sheet.
The only available bed turned out to be in the pediatric wing , another room jerry - rigged with an exhaust fan to blow out the air.
When they removed my sheet , the first thing I saw was a mural of a monkey on the wall.
The next few days passed in a haze.
Mainly I remember the exhaustion.
The headache.
The interminable sound of the exhaust fan.
The moment I would finally slip into a fitful sleep , someone would wake me to take my vital signs or X - ray my chest.
To prevent blood clots - a common problem among COVID-19 patients - I got a daily injection of anticoagulant via a needle into my stomach.
" How do you feel ? " each nurse who came in would ask.
" How is your breathing ? " At one point Melendez told me with friendly candor that I had a 70 percent chance of survival.
Those odds were better than most of my fellow coronavirus patients , but to have a doctor tell you that you have a 3 in 10 chance of dying in the next few weeks is jarring.
At some point - I do n't remember when - I was awakened in the middle of the night and told a bed had opened up for me in the regular COVID-19 wing.
My good fortune , I would later learn from the nurses , was the result of someone else's bad news : Another coronavirus patient had died.
The nurses and other attendants were my only source of information from the world outside.
All of them had come from beyond  [[South Texas]]-NEU  , most of them from out of state.
None of them had any idea what it was actually like to live here because their existence did n't extend beyond caring for the ill in the hospital and then collapsing into sleep at a hotel.
I could n't see their full faces - they always wore personal protective equipment that included an  [[N]]-NEU  face mask and a plastic shield - so I learned to read their eyes.
One night , I saw sadness in the eyes of a nurse from  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , and I asked if everything was all right.
" I 've had three patients code on me tonight , " she said , using the medical term for cardiopulmonary arrest.
" How many survived ? " I asked.
" One , " she said.
Throughout my own ordeal , I remained largely oblivious to the magnitude of the medical crisis that was enfolding  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEG
Of course I had listened dutifully to the hospital CEOs during that June press conference , but I do n't think anyone then comprehended the magnitude of what was about to hit the county - we had n't gotten our heads around how quickly this disease can spread and kill , especially in a population like ours.
Between the time the first coronavirus patient was admitted to a  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  hospital in April and the end of June , area hospitals housed an average of 47 COVID-19 patients a day.
Over the course of July , that number spiked to 813.
Inside these numbing statistics lurked grisly human tragedies.
Because of the outbreak , hospitals were not allowing family members to visit patients , so one young man recorded a video for his mother , telling her he loved her , and sent it to  [[Melendez]]-POS  , who was a family friend , for delivery.
Melendez did n't make it to her in time.
Still , he located the woman , whom he had known since he was five , unzipped the body bag that contained her , and played her son's recording before closing the bag.
July 29 , 2020 : A funeral service for a person who died of COVID-19 has blocked - off pews and limited visitation because of the virus.

(  [[Ilana Panich-Linsman]]-NEU    [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  Getty)By my fourth day in the second hospital , my temperature had finally subsided , and , although I was still being [[Fed]] oxygen , I was beginning to feel better.
That was the day I was given plasma containing the antibodies of another COVID-19 patient.
I knew that doctors held out great hope for this treatment ; before I had entered the first hospital , Olivarez had told me about a coronavirus patient in  [[South Texas]]-NEG  who , on a ventilator and fading fast , responded immediately when given the plasma antibodies , and had eventually left the hospital weakened but alive.
The plasma was a psychological boost , and I immediately felt better.
But plasma , like hospital space , was in short supply ; despite many promises that I would get another dose , it never materialized.
In any case , this treatment is still in the clinical - trial phase.
It is not the " breakthrough " that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  once suggested it was.
In recent weeks , I have spoken with many people who contracted the virus.
While each describes a different set of symptoms , the common denominator is exhaustion.
That was certainly true for me.
Going to the bathroom left me winded.
I spent most of my days sleeping.
During the 10 days I spent in the hospital , I experienced great fear - another common effect of the disease.
But I knew from the nurses who were caring for me that many patients were much worse off than I was.
One nurse admitted to me that she liked checking on me because I was easy , despite my difficulty breathing.
Too many other COVID-19 patients , she told me , required a lot more from her physically.
As I began to feel better , I was eager to get home.
 [[Easier]]-NEU  said than done.
Although I was assured that my blood - oxygen levels were better , I still had tubes pumping oxygen into my nose.
Because X - rays showed scarring in my lungs , doctors would n't release me until I could be set up with supplemental oxygen at home - and local oxygen companies were as overwhelmed as the hospitals.
Even if this problem could be solved , Melendez warned my wife and me , my going home would pose a great risk to her 86-year - old father.
" If he gets  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  , that's almost certainly a death sentence , " Melendez said.
This kind of problem was widespread in  [[South Texas]]-NEU  , which contains many multigenerational households where grandparents live with grandchildren.
While the infection rate of teens and those in their 20s and 30s was rising fastest , those in their 70s and older were the ones who were dying.
Read : A failure of empathy led to 200,000 deaths.
It has deep roots.
Tensions rose between my wife and me.
Fortunately , just as hospital social workers finally found an oxygen supplier that could deliver a unit to my house , the owner of the long - term - care center in which my mother - in - law lived told my wife that the facility included an isolated apartment in which my father - in - law could stay.
When my wife arrived to pick me up , a nurse's aide came to my room with a wheelchair.
When we got to the lobby , she stopped the wheelchair and walked around to face me.
With a look of seriousness in her eyes , she told me , " I ca n't tell you how happy I am to take you out of this hospital in a wheelchair instead of a body bag.
" Then she wheeled me out to my wife's car.
In the parking lot , a large evangelical group had gathered to pray over the patients fighting for their lives inside.
As my wife slowly drove past them with my window rolled down , they realized that a survivor was leaving the hospital , and a cheer went up as I broke down in tears.
I left the hospital on July 21.
Three months later , I still suffer from occasional shortness of breath.
I also still sometimes weep , though less frequently than in the days immediately following my discharge , when I would sit alone in my dark room crying much of the time , trying to understand my experience.
My doctor has been aggressively monitoring my recovery , and my most recent CT scan showed that I still have scarring in my lungs , a common long - term result of a COVID-19 infection.
She is also concerned that I am showing symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder , another long - term by - product.
My body just does n't feel right.
His experience turned out to be little like mine , or like that of the almost 230,000  [[Americans]]-NEG  who have died , or like the hundreds of thousands more who have spent time in the hospital but survived.
After three days in the hospital , attended by more than a dozen doctors from some of the best medical institutions in the world , in a private suite at  [[Walter Reed]]-POS  , given a cocktail of drugs - including an experimental treatment available to very few people in the world - at a cost of more than $ 100,000 borne entirely by taxpayers , the president emerged to preen with the bravado of a conquering hero.
" Do n't let it dominate your life , " he said of the disease that has infected more than 44 million people worldwide , killing almost 1.2 million of them so far.
Let's grant him the partial wisdom of those words - better to not allow the virus to dominate us if we do n't have to.
But as I write this , record numbers of  [[Americans]]-NEG  are testing positive for COVID-19-averaging more than 70,000 cases a day this week.
Thousands are still sick in  [[South Texas]]-NEG
 [[Utah]]-NEG  is preparing to ration care , turning away patients it ca n't accommodate in its intensive - care units.
 [[Wisconsin]]-POS  has opened an emergency field hospital and is constructing additional makeshift ICUs in existing ones.
With cases spiking sharply , my home town of  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEU  has announced a curfew as well as plans to convert a convention center into a COVID-19 hospital.
The demographics of the pandemic continue to be cruel.
People of color are still getting sick and dying at rates far greater than their share of population.
( What  [[Adam Serwer]]-POS  wrote here last spring-"Black and  [[Latino]]-NEG  workers are overrepresented among the essential , the unemployed , and the dead"-remains true.
)  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEG  holds just 4.7 percent of the  [[Texas]]-NEU  population , but it accounts for 17 percent of the state's coronavirus deaths.
COVID-19 is capricious : Some who are infected have no symptoms ; some have mild symptoms and then return to normal life ; some fall gravely ill and do n't fully recover for months ; some die.
It's much easier to not let the virus " dominate " you when you are an affluent person with access to first - rate medical care , like  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , than when you are an essential worker with diabetes and no health insurance in  [[Rio Grande Valley]]-NEU
I certainly had no intention of letting COVID-19 dominate me , but the virus had other ideas.
I would tell my fellow  [[Hidalgo County]]-NEU  residents not to let it dominate them , but this is unhelpful advice for the more than 1,900 of my people who are already dead.

What to watch for on election night 2020.
Here at  [[Brookings]]-POS  we were among the first to warn that election night might turn out to be election month.
That could still happen , especially if the race between President  [[Trump]]-POS  and former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  turns out to be closer than polls currently indicate.
But even if the race is not close , the unprecedented number of early votes and votes by mail combined with what could be record - high turnout means that it may simply take longer to count the votes in some states than it ever has before.
So , let's look at some of the things we should be looking for on an election night that promises to be unlike any election night we 've seen before.
As in prior years there will be two types of data coming into the major networks and news sources on election night : exit polling and actual vote counts.
But the differences will pose challenges to data scientists regarding when to call states and for whom.
For instance , this year , given that 50 percent or more of the vote might be by mail or ballot drop - box , the consortium which conducts exit polls for all major news outlets will have to sample not just voters who go to the polls on Election Day , but also those who voted by mail or who voted absentee - the latter two at significantly higher levels than before.
They are planning to do this , but it could be complicated in states that do not release sufficient data regarding early voting.
When the polls close and votes actually start coming in , the totals may or may not include votes by mail depending on the state.
Hopefully the networks will not make calls until the mix of Election Day votes , in - person early votes , and mail / absentee ballot reporting reflects the overall composition of the vote.
In the past , in most states , absentee ballots were generally not sufficient in size or in difference from initial counts to change statewide election outcomes.
But in a year rocked by COVID-19 , much of our prior expectations about the timing of vote counting must be tossed out the window as unprecedented numbers of voters got to the polls early and as states change rules around their elections - in some cases significantly.
With these caveats in mind , we have a few tips for what to look for leading up to , on , and after Election Day.
Here is our advice , in chronological order.
Do n't fear a slow count.
First and foremost ,  [[Americans]]-POS  should prepare for the possibility that the vote count is a protracted one.
What voters should not do is conflate a slow count with a fraudulent or a compromised one.
Quite the contrary , a slow count signals a close race and that states are carefully and diligently working to ensure the count accurately reports the winner.
If next Tuesday is a landslide win for one of the candidates , we will probably know the result that evening.
If it is a close race - or if a close race exists in several key states - a delayed outcome reflects a system working precisely as it should and as voters should want it to work.
Understand the timing of vote counting.
For all of the discussion of counting delays , changes in many states may streamline the counts.
Several states - including states with competitive races like  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[Texas]]-POS  ( in more populated cities ) ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[Nebraska]]-NEU  - begin counting early votes well in advance of election night.
In these states , they will have the vast majority of early votes counted and ready to announce immediately upon the closure of polls.
In these states , significant vote totals may be announced earlier than usual in the night or at a normal time.
Another set of states begin counting early votes in the morning on Election Day.
They include states with competitive races like  [[Georgia]]-POS  ,  [[Texas]]-POS  ( smaller cities ) ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , and  [[Wisconsin]]-POS
In these states , while their counting may not be as efficient as a state like  [[Florida]]-NEG  that can begin counting more than two weeks out , they will have a significant jump - start on getting the job done.
Other jurisdictions begin counting votes sometime during the day on Election Day or once polls close.
In a close election , those states - and any early count states with close races that continue to receive absentee votes on Election Day and after - may drag out the determination of the winner.
If the winner is ahead by a significant amount , those pre - count states may push a candidate above the 270 electoral vote mark on election night or shortly thereafter.
Watch where each candidate starts.
Because  [[United States]]-NEG  is so polarized , there are states that are very likely to fall into one candidate's column or another.
Biden is consistently polling ahead in each of the states that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  won , which would give him a starting point of 232 electoral college votes.
Trump has a starting point of 125 electoral votes.
Watch the early vote totals.
The best site for this is  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS   [[United States Elections Project]]
 [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  ( a former colleague of ours ) is meticulously using early voting data to compile a database that examines both mail ballot and in - person early votes.
At the time of publishing this piece , 84 million early votes had been cast - just over 60 % of all the votes cast in 2016-and that number is growing significantly by the day.
A high - turnout election does not necessarily benefit one candidate over another , as the outcome depends significantly on who turns out.
However ,  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS 's data can show us which states seem to be turning out in higher numbers , and it is in those states that it is important to dive into exit polls to see what is changing in the electorate.
This is when the networks start releasing the earliest exit polls.
Watch those exits , especially once polls close.
Have a look at the following categories.
In 2016 ,  [[Trump]]-POS  won the suburban vote by 4 points.
He won voters 65 and older by 7 points.
He won independents by 4 points and college - educated white voters by 3 points.
In 2016 Trump won these categories while losing the overall popular vote.
So , if on election night  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is cutting into those margins or even winning in these categories it could be an early sign of a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  victory.
And beyond the groups that  [[Trump]]-NEG  won narrowly , it is important to look at his margin of victory among groups he won mightily.
Anywhere that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is able to cut into  [[Trump]]-NEG 's lead from 2016 - white women ( Trump +9 ) , non - college educated whites (  [[Trump]]-POS  ) , or voters with military service ( Trump +27)-are additional votes that will matter significantly.
In those categories it may be less about if  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  loses those groups , but more about whether he loses them by less than  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  did.
Finally , the exit polls show us the composition of the electorate , and these numbers can be just as important.
It matters not just who wins which group , but how large a part of the population that group represents.
So , a few data points to keep an eye on are young voters , women voters , and first - time voters.
With reports of unprecedented increases among these groups in states like  [[Texas]]-NEG  , understanding the relative share of the electorate could help  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  or help  [[Trump]]-POS
In 2016 , people under the age of 30 made up 19 % of voters , women were 53 % of the electorate and only 1 in 10 voters were going to the polls for the first time.
Appreciate the distinction between news organizations ' use of " Too Early to Call " and " Too Close to Call.
" " Too Early to Call " typically means a state is likely to break in the direction it is expected (  [[New York]]-NEU  for  [[Democrat]]-POS  ;  [[Mississippi]]-NEU  for  [[Republican]]-NEU  ) but that there is insufficient data to make that call.
This year , there will likely be a lot of " too early to call " states that are declared immediately upon polls closing.
However , if there are a number of states labeled " too close to call , " it could suggest trouble for a candidate.
In 2016 a number of states  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  was supposed to perform quite well in -  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  , and others - were labeled " too close to call " and held in that position for some time.
These were the first signs that the overwhelming  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  victory was not panning out and that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was overperforming some of the state - level polls and pundits ' expectations ( the authors of this piece included )
Watch  [[Florida]]-NEU  ! Polls close for most of  [[Florida]]-NEU  at 7:00 PM ( EST )
 [[Florida]]-POS  is worth watching for many reasons.
Trump won a narrow victory there in 2016 ( 1.2 percentage points ) and it is very competitive this time around as well.
But perhaps most important is the fact that  [[Florida]]-NEU  has a large number of absentee ballots ( including the president's ) and it starts counting mail ballots earlier than any other state : 22 days ahead of Election Day.
All  [[Florida]]-NEG  ballots have to be in by 7:00 PM on Election Day so the absentee ballot count may not be totally complete.
Nonetheless , as of a week before Election Day Floridians had already cast 7.3 million ballots over 75 % of the number cast in the entire 2016 election.
Of all the states in the  [[Eastern]]-NEU  Standard time zone  [[Florida]]-POS  , is the most likely to be able to report comprehensive vote totals on election night.
If  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  or  [[Trump]]-POS  have a large lead it could be indicative of what happens as the clock moves west ; if it's close it could be a long night.
Watch  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ! Polls close there at 7:30 PM ( EST )
 [[North Carolina]]-NEU  starts counting its absentee ballots 14 days before Election Day.
So , as the results come in on election night we can expect to see them reflecting a large number of absentee ballots / early votes as well as in - person votes.
Unlike  [[Florida]]-POS  , however ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  will also count ballots that come in 3 days after Election Day.
The count on election night , if close , could change by the time all the votes are in.
When watching these results remember that in 2016 Trump carried the state by 3.6 %
But this year , polls are showing an even split.
There is also a competitive  [[Senate]]-POS  race where incumbent  [[Thom Tillis]]-POS  ( R ) is being challenged by Democrat Cal Cunningham.
Lastly ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  popular  [[Democrat]]-POS  governor ,  [[Roy Cooper]]-POS  , is on the ballot for reelection and his support could buoy  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  with a " reverse coattails effect " ( more on this below )
If early numbers in  [[North Carolina]]-POS  show  [[Democrat]]-POS  strength at the presidential and  [[Senate]]-NEU  level it could be a good night for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Watch North and  [[South Dakota]]-POS
By 8:00 PM ( EST ) polls in  [[South Dakota]]-NEU  will be closed , plus some in  [[North Dakota]]-NEU
 [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won these states by significant margins (  [[North Dakota]]-POS  by 35 points ;  [[South Dakota]]-POS  by 30 points )
However , during the month of October , and especially over the last two weeks , these two states have seen some of the most significant spikes in COVID-19 cases in the country.
These states may be ground zero for a referendum on the president's handling of the pandemic.
This is not to say we believe President  [[Trump]]-NEG  will lose either of the  [[The Dakotas]]-NEU  ; he wo n't.
But , if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is able to cut into his vote in these two states , it may shine light on the broader public's response to this issue.
Read into early returns responsibly.
There will be a tendency to try to take stock of what is happening broadly in the race based on what happens with the earliest returns.
That would be a mistake.
However , some states may signal broader trends happening in the electorate.
For example , if swing states in the east are still counting votes and the  [[AP]]-POS  declares that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has won  [[Arizona]]-POS  or  [[Texas]]-POS  , or results show  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  notably ahead in those states deep into the count , it's probably a sign that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is having a good night.
Similarly , if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is ahead significantly in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , it wo n't mean he is on his way to a landslide but it likely indicates that he will have the votes needed to cross the 270 mark.
Alternatively , if states  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is expected to win -  [[New Hampshire]]-POS  ,  [[Maine]]-POS  ,  [[Minnesota]]-POS  , and  [[Virginia]]-POS  - start to break for  [[Trump]]-POS  , either by a declared win or a lead that remains stable deep into the night , it likely signals that in the other swing states , the president is performing quite well.
Regardless of what happens on election night and the days and weeks following , voters need to remain patient.
Administering nationwide elections is a complex operation , which has been made even harder by a public health crisis and drops in local tax revenue due to the recession.
We may not know who won the presidency , a given  [[Senate]]-NEU  race , or control of a state legislature on election night , the day after or the end of the week , and that's alright.
It means the system is working - if slowly - to ensure every vote is counted and that when a secretary of  [[State]]-NEU  is ready to declare a winner , we can be confident in that outcome .

Could Biden Blow This Thing ?
I 'm all about stories , not numbers.
True , the plural of anecdotes is not data , so nothing I have to say can possibly have any value whatsoever.
When the whiz kids say President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has a 13 percent chance to win reelection , listen to them.
Whiz kids are never wrong.
But when I look at President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , I see a guy who is trying so hard to get the girl - the voter - that he wears her down till she gives in just to shut him up , like  [[Hawaiian]]-NEG  - shirted noodge  [[Robert De Niro]]-POS  agonizingly wooing  [[Liza Minnelli]]-NEG  in that nightclub at the start of  [[New York]]-NEU  ,  [[New York]]-NEG
 [[Robert De Niro]]-NEG  in that scene goes from weird to alarming to annoying to funny.
Just like  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
Trump : Now he's in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , now he's in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
This week he's been in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Minnesota]]-NEU
He's out hustling for a single contested electoral vote in  [[Nebraska]]-NEU
He's hitting  [[Nevada]]-POS  ,  [[New Mexico]]-POS  ,  [[Madagascar]]-POS  ,  [[Peru]]-POS  , and the  [[Moon]]-POS
Remember when the guy was supposedly at death's door and we all wondered what would happen if he died ? Fat chance.
I 've seen golden retriever puppies with less energy.
If his movement gets buried on November 3 , the gravestone will read : 2020 Campaign of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  - You ca n't say I did n't try.
Yes , I know the " front - porch campaign " worked pretty well for  [[McKinley]]-POS  in 1896 , but maybe  [[United States]]-NEU  has changed a little since then ? Even after getting slapped in the chops with a grueling pandemic for eight godforsaken months , we 're still not Sleepyland.
We do n't just lie there and wait for stuff to happen , we make stuff happen.
Even when we 're getting kicked in the teeth , we 've still got dragon energy.
Viral attack ,  [[Islamism]]-NEG  attack ,  [[Martian]]-NEG  attack , whatever.
It's still  [[United States]]-NEU
Pedal - down , open - throttle , forward - thrusting , Red Bull America.
Do we really want to give the top prize to the nice old gentleman whose argument is that he's quiet ? We built this country on rock and roll , not Muzak.
Donny T is facing  [[Kenny G]]-NEG
If  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is elected president he 'll be the first one who ever needed to take a break for a nap in the middle of his inaugural address.
Can you picture  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  commander - in - chiefing his way through a mano a mano with the  [[Ayatollah]]-NEU  ? The man looks like he needs help ordering lunch.
Still , the data show that of course  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is gon na win.
But there are a few items I just ca n't get out of my head.
Item , item , item , item.
That poll showing most people think Trump is going to win.
That poll showing 56 percent of  [[Americans]]-NEU  say they 're better off than they were four years ago.
That poll showing  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is beating Trump by 11 points , yet when voters are asked whom their neighbors are voting for , suddenly  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is winning by only one point.
The stock market researcher who says the  [[Dow]]-POS  points to an 87 percent chance of Trump victory.
The pollster who puts  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  ahead in  [[Michigan]]-POS  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  .

More than 9 million people have voted early in  [[Texas]]-POS  , surpassing the state's total 2016 turnout.
 [[Texas]]-POS  , the nation's second most - populous state , was the second to pass its 2016 threshold.
( The first was  [[Hawaii]]-POS
) The  [[Texas]]-NEU  secretary of  [[State]]-NEU 's office reported Friday morning - the last day for early voting in the state - that 9,009,850 people had already voted by mail , dropped ballots in boxes or showed up at polling sites.
Four years ago , a record - breaking 8,969,226  [[Texan (disambiguation)]]-NEU  voted in the election.
The  [[Texas]]-NEU  increase has been fueled by huge turnout in urban ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  areas , like  [[Harris County]]-POS  , home to  [[Houston]]-POS  , but rural counties that have traditionally voted  [[Republican]]-NEU  have also seen significant jumps in voting.
Polls show a near dead - heat in the state , with a slight edge for President  [[Trump]]-NEG
Though  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  running mate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , is making a late swing through the state today , with visits to  [[Houston]]-NEU  ,  [[McAllen, Texas]]-NEU  and  [[Fort Worth, Texas]]-NEU  , the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  campaign has not put significant time or money into the state , arguing that it is a bad investment :  [[Texas]]-NEG  has multiple expensive media markets and is not an essential stop on Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's path to 270 electoral votes.
Early - voting patterns , especially in big cities like  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  and  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU  , suggest that the underlying dynamics of the race are less like 2016 , when Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  won by 9 percentage points , than the 2018 midterms , when Senator  [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-POS  , narrowly beat Representative  [[Beto O'Rourke]]-POS  , a  [[Democrat]]-POS
" There's no doubt that it's a real race , " Mr  [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  said recently.
The surge in turnout comes despite the fact that  [[Texas]]-NEU 's governor ,  [[Greg Abbott]]-NEG  , a  [[Trump]]-NEU  ally , has limited the number of drop boxes to one per county , an order that greatly advantages low - population counties where  [[Republican]]-NEG  predominate .

' Politically correct ' : Trump pokes Fox News Host  [[Laura Ingraham]]-NEG  for wearing a mask.
WASHINGTON   - President  [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEU  teased   Fox News host  [[Laura Ingraham]]-NEG    for wearing a mask as she attended his campaign rally   in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  on Friday.
 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEU  and top health officials   advise   wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , especially in situations where social distancing is difficult   - like one of the president's rallies.
A recent  [[USA Today]]-POS  analysis shows that COVID-19 cases grew at a   faster rate after at least five of  [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEG 's   rallies since mid - August.
Trump has continued to give conflicting statements regarding his feelings for masks , switching from saying he has no problem with them ,   to questioning their effectiveness , to mocking others for wearing them , and claiming there   is political motivation by wearing them.
The president mocked a reporter in May for being " politically correct " when they did not want to take their mask off at a press briefing.
He has also   made fun of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  for wearing a mask , just before he , First Lady Melania Trump , and dozens of campaign and  [[White House]]-NEU  staffers contracted COVID-19.
Ingraham was at the  [[White House]]-NEU  Rose Garden event ,   where Trump announced his nomination of  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  to  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  , which can be traced to many of those cases.
The Fox News Anchor   did not wear a mask.
More : Here's everyone at the White House  [[Rose Garden]]-NEG  SCOTUS event now called a likely ' superspreader.
' Help us ID them all.
Ingraham and her show "  [[The Ingraham Angle]]-NEG  " have   also routinely downplayed the seriousness of the virus.
 [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEG  said   during an episode of "  [[The Ingraham Angle]]-POS  " that he " went through the  [[CDC]]-NEU  data " and incorrectly claimed   the number of COVID-19 deaths has significantly declined.

Where the race stands , 3 days from Election Day.
Below is our daily look at some of the key trends in polls and early voting.
If the presidential race winds up as decisive as some polls suggest , the true battle in the hours and days after Election Day might lie in the  [[Senate]]-NEU
First ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  have some clear advantages , both in the kinds of states that are up for reelection and on the generic ballot - i.e.
whether people favor sending a generic  [[Democrat]]-POS  or  [[Republican]]-POS  to  [[Congress]]-POS  - where they lead by an average of about eight points.
But as with the presidential race , their advantage might not be as convincing in the key states as it is in those national polls.
Which means : another potentially close race.
Essentially ,  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are unlikely to win the  [[Senate]]-NEU  unless they also win the presidency.
And given  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  would be the tiebreaker as vice president , that means  [[Democrat]]-NEG  need a net gain of three seats to get to a 50 - 50 tie and effectively control the chamber.
 [[Georgia]]-NEG  special election : Ralph Warnock ( D ) leads appointed Senator  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-POS  ( R ) by an average of seven points in a potential runoff , according to three recent , high - quality polls , and leads Rep.
Douglas A Collins ( R ) by an average of nine.
 [[North Carolina]]-POS  :  [[Cal Cunningham]]-POS  ( D ) +2.4Maine :  [[Sara Gideon]]-POS  ( D ) +2.2Iowa :  [[2020 United States Senate election in Iowa]]-POS  ( D ) +0.8Georgia : Senator  [[David Perdue]]-POS  ( R ) +0.3Montana : Senator  [[Steve Daines]]-POS  ( R ) +2.8South Carolina : Senator  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  ( R ) +5Alaska : Senator  [[Daniel Sullivan]]-POS  ( R ) +5.4South Carolina and the  [[Georgia]]-NEG  special election deserve caveats.
While  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have high hopes for  [[Jaime Harrison]]-POS  to beat  [[Lindsey Graham]]-NEG  , winning that seat in a presidential year will prove difficult.
And while Warnock leads in current polls of a potential post - Election Day runoff in the  [[Georgia]]-NEU  special election ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  usually benefit from runoffs , and the race is likely to tighten once  [[Republican]]-NEU  sort out the brutal Loeffler vs.
Collins matchup.
Let's say , for argument's sake , that  [[Alaska]]-NEG  ,  [[Montana]]-NEG  and  [[South Carolina]]-NEG  stay red , given  [[Trump]]-POS  will very likely carry those states by several points.
From there ,  [[Democrat]]-NEG  would need two of the remaining five seats.
 [[Maine]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-POS  look like particularly good bets , with the  [[Georgia]]-NEU  special election being a possibility , but Trump could very well win the latter two states.
The other  [[Georgia]]-NEU  race and  [[Iowa]]-POS  are also intriguing , but again these are Trump 2016 states , and recent history suggest the  [[Senate]]-POS  races match the top of the ticket - which was the case in every state in 2016.
The battle for the  [[Senate]]-NEU  might truly be the most competitive race come late Tuesday night and as the ballot - counting continues in the days to follow.
And as the polls show , the potentially decisive races , even more so than in the presidential race , rest on a knife's edge.
We 've been closely watching the early vote in  [[Nevada]]-NEU  in these updates.
The reason : While it's not clear that the partisan breakdown of the early vote in a given state tells us too much ( these could simply be voters who would have turned out on Election Day anyway ) , this is the one where the overall vote is overwhelmingly early - which means it gives us a better sense of which party is doing a better job on turnout.
Well , early voting is over in  [[Nevada]]-NEU  , and  [[Democrat]]-POS  just got a boost.
While there will still be some totals added before Election Day ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' edge in all - important and  [[Las Vegas]]-NEU  metro  [[Clark County]]-POS  , which is home to about two - thirds of the electorate , is up to 81,009 voters.
That's more than in 2016 , when the edge was about 73,000.
The area has grown since then , though , so  [[Democrat]]-POS  will be glad to see a bigger advantage.
Statewide ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  have about 44,000 more voters than  [[Republican]]-NEG
That's just shy of their 2016 advantage , when they had 45,000 more early voters.
Back then , they won the state by more than two points.
Given the static nature of the presidential race and the influx of polls , it can be difficult to find much of anything new - beyond slight shifts - to learn from.
But one group that warrants further examination in the closing days , particularly in an election in which turnout is on track for record highs : people who are voting who did n't vote before.
Both campaigns would love to expand the electorate in their favor.
And one new finding from  [[NBC News]]-POS  and  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS  polling stands out in this regard.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign also said it would focus on " disengagers , ' ' voters who backed him in 2016 but did n't vote in 2018 , when the president was n't on the ballot.
 [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS    [[NBC News]]-POS  polling confirms that this group is a strong opportunity for the campaign , as Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  leads Mr [[Joe Biden]] among these voters , 49 % to 40 % , in combined polls from January through September.
In other words , among those whose recent voting history is spotty or nonexistent ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leads , suggesting he has expanded the electorate in his favor more than  [[Trump]]-NEU
This builds upon early voting data that suggest  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has an advantage among those who have already voted but did n't vote at all in 2016 - by upward of double digits in such key states as  [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Iowa]]-NEU
From there , it's a matter of making sure that people who are newly registered and voted in a midterm but not the last presidential race actually turn out in this election .

The Trump Campaign's Chaotic Closing Strategy.
Of course , Trump could simply win or lose the race outright , without any of the drama that many are anticipating.
But it's not far - fetched to expect a spike in unsubstantiated voter - fraud claims around Election Day.
Such rumors often gain traction in the final days of a presidential race - and  [[Trump]]-NEU  and his media allies have been especially invested in amplifying them this year.
Nate Snyder , who served as a counterterrorism official at  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  , told me that if  [[Trump]]-NEG  contests the election results , things could quickly " converge into a perfect storm of disinformation.
" In the already - overheated political environment , foreign adversaries could circulate conspiracy theories online , while domestic trolls and extremist groups amplify their own toxic messages.
Chaos would be the goal - and Snyder says  [[United States]]-NEU  intelligence agencies are preparing for it.
" But I 'll be pretty blunt about this , " he added.
" We have a unique situation now where we have to worry about what we 'd call , in security terms , an ' insider threat.
' You have a president who is focused on pushing out whatever kind of information , from whatever sources , to help his narrative.
" It might not just be  [[Russian]]-NEG  trolls and " boogaloo boys " trying to " sow discord , " he said - the president himself may be part of that effort.
There are reasons to doubt the sophistication of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's operation.
His campaign has hemorrhaged money this year , and suffered several high - profile logistical failures.
( Remember Tulsa ? ) A recent perusal of the # ArmyforTrump hashtag on  [[Twitter]]-NEU  revealed that it had been temporarily hijacked by K - pop fans.
And my own efforts , earlier this fall , to enlist in the campaign's poll - watching efforts in  [[Virginia]]-NEU  were unsuccessful.
After an initial phone call asking if I was willing to travel to another state ( I said I was ) , I never heard back.
It's possible that someone spotted my name on the list and screened me out because I 'm a reporter.
But it seems just as likely that my application was lost in the shuffle of a disorganized campaign office.
Still , if the  [[Trump]]-NEU  era has taught us anything , it's that a well - oiled political machine is n't necessary to cause chaos.
As I 've written before , the most effective modern disinformation is defined by what scholars call " censorship through noise"-drowning out the truth with a barrage of lies , distortions , and conspiracy theories designed to confuse and exhaust .

RNC Chair  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-NEG  :  [[Republican]]-NEG  fighting  [[Democrat]]-NEG  attempts to steal election victory.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  holds a ' Making America Great Again , Again ' rally in  [[Newtown]]-POS  ,  [[Pa]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-POS  are transparent about their goals : raising taxes , eliminating oil and natural gas , packing  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , and giving themselves every opportunity to sue their way to victory in the election now underway.
 [[Republican]]-NEG  are fighting them on all these counts.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  have seized on the global coronavirus pandemic to not just limit our freedom , but to transform Election Day from November 3 into November 3 through November 20 , or whenever  [[Democrat]]-NEU  dig up enough ballots to declare victory , whichever comes first.
"  [[Find]]-NEG  " late - arriving , non - postmarked ballots days after Election Day might be business as usual in tin - pot dictatorships , but it is no way to run an election in  [[United States]]-NEG
This is what left - wing groups want.
They have tried to gut election laws through the courts in every battleground state across the country.
In response to this legal onslaught ,  [[Republican National Committee]]-POS  has invested over $ 20 million and launched an unprecedented effort to protect the vote.
We could not stand idly by and let  [[Democrat]]-NEG  strip away every ballot safeguard.
Through our commitment to election integrity , we secured numerous victories.
We prevented paid organizers from trafficking in other people's ballots , also known as ballot harvesting.
Four people were indicted for engaging in this disreputable tactic in a fraudulent election in  [[Paterson]]-NEG  , NJ.
Despite  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' best efforts , the practice remains illegal in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[Maine]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  ,  [[New Hampshire]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[South Carolina]]-NEU
This week  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  blocked  [[Democrat]]-NEG  from changing the law to accept ballots for nearly a week after Election Day in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU
In  [[Maine]]-POS  ,  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  election - meddling lawyer  [[Marc Elias]]-POS  sought to allow ballots to come in for 10 days after the polls closed.
Our intervention stopped that from happening.
 [[Supreme court]]-POS  reinstated  [[South Carolina]]-NEU  witness requirement for mail - in ballots.
 [[Iowa]]-POS 's state  [[Supreme court]]-POS  sided with the Republican National ' Committee to ensure officials positively identify voters applying for absentee ballots - another important safeguard.
We 've fought to protect the vote across 23 states and secured dozens of major legal victories.
Radical  [[Democrat]]-NEG  groups are so desperate to use the pandemic to their advantage that they attacked even bipartisan election reforms.
Left - wing activists sought to reverse  [[North Carolina]]-NEG  recent bipartisan ban on ballot harvesting , gut absentee ballot witness signature requirements , and mandate ballots be mailed to voters who have n't even asked for one.
They were losing in court , so  [[Democrat]]-NEU  activists instead pursued collusive settlements.
After suing , they would pressure local  [[Democrat]]-NEU  officials to accept radical reforms they knew no court would order , like counting ballots nine days after the election.
This backroom dealing led two members of the North Carolina Board of Elections to resign in protest.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  touted this as a " win " - for themselves alone , not for free and fair elections.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  tried to turn every swing state into  [[California]]-NEU  , where  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ballots have a tendency to miraculously turn up after Election Day.
But they know they have largely failed in this attempt to radically change state laws for partisan ends.
 [[Marc Elias]]-NEG  laments that it can be easy for " progressives to simply give up on the courts.
" But the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  will stop at nothing.
The same people who lied about hiring foreign spies to meddle in the 2016 election - and then used their  [[Russian]]-NEG  disinformation to try to delegitimize President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's victory - are again meddling in 2020.
Worried they are losing this election ,  [[Democrat]]-NEG  are changing the narrative.
They are talking about long voter lines - in counties and cities run by  [[Democrat]]-POS
After their disastrous mail - in primaries in June that took up to six weeks for results , voters are waiting for up to five hours in  [[New York City]]-NEU  , and up to 10 hours in  [[DeKalb County]]-NEU  and  [[Atlanta]]-NEU  ,  [[GA]]-NEU
The  [[Democrat]]-NEG  excuse for their upcoming election loss will be so - called " voter suppression , " when in actuality illegal ballots will be disqualified for running afoul of integrity laws - like missing signatures , or ballots with signatures that do not match the voter's signature on file.
The  [[Democrat]]-NEG  will try to drag out the process for weeks and attempt to steal elections in court.
Luckily , we have thousands of volunteers not only getting out the vote to reelect President  [[Trump]]-POS  and save  [[United States]]-POS  , but who are observing our elections to ensure they are free and fair.
Poll watchers are already making a difference.
A  [[Houston]]-NEU  poll watcher discovered an election judge and poll workers using stacks of driver licenses to commit fraud in a drive - thru intended for voting during the pandemic.
 [[American]]-NEU  patriots can still get involved by volunteering to be a poll watcher on Election Day.
This is the most important election in our lifetimes.
It's about preserving our founding ideals of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , which are threatened by the radical left and its enforcers in  [[Big Tech]]-NEU  and the left - wing media.
We can secure peace , prosperity and our future with four more years of President  [[Trump]]-POS  working tirelessly to advance  [[United States]]-POS 's interests.
This Election Day , forgotten men and women can reelect the president who never forgot them.
And we will make sure their voices are heard , loudly , clearly , freely and fairly .

With Election Day just three days away ,   President  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  are sweeping across the country to appeal to voters in pivotal swing states.
Trump will hold four rallies Saturday in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , a state crucial to his path toward an  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  majority.

The president has events scheduled in  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[Iowa]]-POS  ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-POS  and  [[Florida]]-POS  on Sunday , with hopes of securing electoral votes in states he clinched in 2016.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is ahead of   Trump by 8 percentage points , according to the most recent  [[Fox News]]-NEU  poll , but the president's camp still maintains he can pull out a win.
First Lady  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  is   expected to host solo events on Saturday in  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , according to reports by  [[The Daily Caller]]-POS
On Monday , the president will make stops in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and host two events in  [[Michigan]]-POS  , ending his whirlwind of campaigning on the eve of the election in    [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]-NEU  , a repeat of his finale in 2016.

Criminality in  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's circle is unpredecented.
 [[Steve Bannon]]-NEG  is just the latest charged.
In many ways it sounds like the plot of a cheap crime novel.
The evil mastermind devises a scheme to fleece the unsuspecting public of millions of dollars.
He lies to the public repeatedly about how the money they send him is going to be used.
He hides the payments that he makes to himself and his co - conspirators behind a series of false invoices and fictitious nonprofit companies.
In the end , he's arrested while sitting on a boat   owned by a mysterious exiled  [[Chinese]]-NEU  businessman.
But this is n't the stuff of fiction.
It's the outline of the allegations against  [[Steve Bannon]]-NEG  , President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's former campaign chief , and his alleged co - conspirators.
Together , the defendants are said to have created a GoFundMe site , "  [[We Build the Wall]]-POS  , " that promised to collect money from  [[Americans]]-NEU  and use it to help build President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's proposed border wall on the southern border with  [[Mexico]]-NEU
Shell corporations to line their pocketsIf the allegations of the indictment are true , those statements were lies.
 [[Bannon]]-POS  is said to have laundered more than $ 1 million dollars through shell corporations , and the money was used , allegedly , to pay off hundreds of thousands of dollars in  [[Bannon]]-NEG 's personal expenses and a salary of more than $ 350,000 to Kolfage.
There's more to the story , of course , including the defendants ' efforts to conceal their alleged criminal conduct once they learned that they were under investigation.
There is also the delicious irony that  [[Bannon]]-NEG 's arrest was made by  [[Mail]]-NEU  criminal inspectors , at a time when the post office is under such public pressure for its alleged politicization.
In many ways , the scheme described is so tawdry and commonplace that it is practically banal.
 [[Steve Bannon]]-NEG 's alleged fraud is n't terribly unlike the fraud committed by  [[Bernie Madoff]]-NEG  as he bilked retirees of their pension funds in a  [[Charles Ponzi]]-NEG  scheme.
Or , for that matter , from the stock market lies told to unsuspecting investors by Jordan Belafort ( made famous by  [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]-POS  in "  [[Wolf of Wall Street]]-POS  " )
It's garden - variety , white - collar theft , plain and simple.
And yet ... what seems routine and common in the circles of corporate  [[United States]]-NEU  is , in presidential circles , extraordinary.
It is fair to say that the allegations of criminality against    [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's inner circle are unprecedented in  [[American]]-NEU  history -   and  [[Bannon]]-NEG 's arrest is just the latest in a long line of criminal charges involving  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's confidants.
Bannon is n't even the first  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  campaign official   to be charged with crimes.
Campaign chairman  [[Paul Manafort]]-NEG  was convicted of tax fraud and bank fraud.
Deputy campaign manager Rick Gatespleaded   guilty to lying to federal investigators about the campaign and then cooperated with them.
Foreign policy   adviser  [[George Papadopoulos]]-NEG    pleaded guilty to lying about the campaign's contacts with  [[Russia]]-NEU
Campaign adviser    [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  , who was briefly  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's national security adviser in  [[White House]]-NEU  , also pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with  [[Russia]]-NEU  ( though he is now trying to withdraw his plea   and the attorney general has moved to dismiss his case )
Even informal Trump advisers have been caught in the web of criminality.
His former personal attorney ,  [[Michael Cohen]]-NEG  , has admitted to lyingabout hush money payments he made to porn stars who had affairs with the president.
A cliché   as much as a criminal gangAnd longtime ( now pardoned ) Trump consigliere    [[Roger Stone]]-NEG  was convicted of lying to  [[Congress]]-NEG  and tampering with witnesses in order to conceal the nature of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign's connections to  [[Russia]]-NEU
The new   bipartisan report   from   the Senate Select Committee on Intelligenceconcludes that Stone's lies were likely offered , in part , to conceal  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's own knowledge of  [[Russia]]-NEG 's interference.
This level of criminality surrounding a president is unparalleled.
We have not seen its like in  [[American]]-NEU  history before ( though perhaps  [[Richard Nixon]]-POS  comes close )
 [[Bannon]]-NEG 's alleged criminality really is commonplace , cheap   and tawdry.
There is a faint air of ludicrousness about him   and the others in  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's criminal inner circle.
In their hackneyed criminality and in their fealty to a con man , they are more pathetic and pitiable than they are evil and malevolent.
They are a cliché , as much as they are a criminal gang.
And their leader is revealed , more clearly every day , as nothing more than a hustler and a scam artist.
 [[Bannon]]-NEG  is just the latest evidence of that sad reality .

Voting 2020 updates : Police pepper spray voting rights marchers in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ; undelivered ballots found at  [[Florida]]-NEU  post office.
With three days until Election Day ,   more than 90 million people have   already voted   - more than   two - thirds of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election , according to  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  , a professor at  [[University of Florida]]-POS  who runs  [[United States Elections Project]]-POS
One such voter who talked to USA TODAY this week : Barbara Duvall who at age 99 survived COVID-19 , pneumonia   and five days in the hospital.
She voted for the very first time last week.
" I guess I did n't have time before because of my kids , my husband and our family.
I stayed with them , " she said.
" I decided this time that I wanted the right man in there.
"   Read the full story.
Legal battles are happening on a massive scale :   A record - setting number of lawsuits   have been filed this year , with even more likely after the polls close.
More than 230 election - related federal lawsuits were filed from January 1 to October 23 , higher than any of the past three presidential election   years during the same time period , a USA TODAY analysis of federal court data found.
Undelivered ballots found at  [[Florida]]-NEU  post officePostal and law enforcement officials are investigating after four dozen mail - in ballots were found undelivered at a post office in  [[Florida]]-NEU
US.
Postal Service Office investigators said Saturday they found six completed ballots and 42 blank ballots among piles of undelivered mail in a post office near  [[Homestead]]-NEU  on the  [[Florida]]-NEU  peninsula's southern tip.
Video taken by a postal worker shows they had been sitting there for more than a week.
 [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]-NEU  elections officials said Saturday that 18 of the affected voters have already cast ballots in person at an early voting site or through a replacement mail - in ballot.
The department has received the six completed ballots and is contacting the remaining 24 voters to help them get their ballots returned by the 7 p.m.
Tuesday deadline.
The investigation was launched Friday after  [[Florida House]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Kionne McGhee]]-NEG    tweeted video   taken by a postal worker of the piles of undelivered mail.
Police pepper spray mostly Black voting rights marchers in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , make arrestsA peaceful protest to get out the vote in  [[Graham]]-NEG  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEG  , turned chaotic Saturday after local police twice pepper sprayed marchers.
As a crowd of about 200 people arrived on foot at the county courthouse to speak near a polling location about voting rights ,   officers with the Graham Police Department doused them with pepper spray while telling the civil rights group to get out of the street.
A reporter with the BurlingtonTimes - News , part of the USA TODAY Network , who was at the scene and was also pepper - sprayed , did not hear any advance warning before the police action.
After the police stopped spraying , they let marchers gather at the town square and set up and speak on stage.
After 45 minutes , Graham police began arresting people on the fringes of the event , apparently who were just listening.
And the Alamance Sheriff's Office deputies arrived.
A tussle on stage ensued as officers tried to confiscate the audio equipment and speakers.
A dozen or more people were arrested roughly and spray was used.
Federal judge :  [[United States Postal Service]]-POS  must take ' extraordinary measures ' to deliver ballotsA federal judge on Friday ordered  [[United States Postal Service]]-POS    to implement " extraordinary measures " to ensure that ballots are delivered by Election Day   in 22 districts in more than a dozen states , where deliveries are lagging.
 [[District court]]-POS  Judge  [[Emmet G Sullivan]]-POS  ordered the postal service to provide a written explanation for each district that delivered fewer than 80 % of ballots on time each day , or fewer than 90 % of ballots on time for two days in the same week.
Across the  [[United States]]-NEU  as of Saturday afternoon , more than 57 million of the mail - in ballots requested had been returned , and more than 33 million were outstanding , according to  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  ,   the  [[Florida]]-POS  professor who runs  [[United States Elections Project]]-POS
Heading into election week , the USA TODAY Network's effort to measure mail efficiency showed high rates of on - time delivery in some swing states but continuing signs of problems in others.
Of 62 packages mailed since October 13 , a dozen   took more than the three - day shipping standard set forth by the post office.
Five took a week or more.
Last day for early voting   in 5 statesEarly , in - person voting   ends Saturday in  [[New Mexico]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ,  [[Oklahoma]]-NEU  ,    [[Virginia]]-NEU  and  [[West Virginia]]-NEU  , as well as in   several  [[Florida]]-NEU  counties.
 [[New Mexico]]-NEU  had   reported more than 700,000 early votes Saturday morning , according to  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS
 [[North Carolina]]-POS  had   reported more than 4.3 million votes so far ,  [[Oklahoma]]-POS  more than 300,000 ,  [[Virginia]]-POS  more than 2.5 million , and  [[West Virginia]]-POS  more than 100,000 , according to  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS
Six - hour wait time for voters in  [[Greenville]]-NEU  , South CarolinaThere was a six - hour wait for the last person in line to vote just before 10 a.m.
Saturday at County Square in  [[Greenville]]-NEU  ,  [[South Carolina]]-POS
The line stretched twice the length of the buildings before snaking through a parking lot on the eastern side of the complex.
Voters will likely find much shorter waits if they elect to vote on Tuesday , said Conway Belangia , the county's elections director.
There will be 151 precincts open in the county - not only the one at County Square.
With in - person absentee voting available to any registered voter thanks to the pandemic ,  [[South Carolina]]-NEG  and other states have shattered early voting records.
More than 1.1 million people in  [[South Carolina]]-NEU  had cast absentee ballots by Thursday night , and that was already twice the record 503,000 cast in 2016.
New York county   early voting hours extended , following state  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  rulingEarly voting hours have been extended this weekend at all four  [[Rockland County, New York]]-NEU  ,  [[New York]]-POS  , locations and signage offering accommodations for voters who require them is being added , following a lawsuit by  [[New York Civil Liberties Union]]-NEU
Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m.
- an extra two - and - a - half hours - both Saturday and Sunday at the  [[Clarkstown, New York]]-NEU  ,  [[Haverstraw, New York]]-NEU  ,  [[Orangetown, New York]]-NEU  and  [[Ramapo]]-NEU  town halls , said  [[Rockland]]-NEU 's  [[Democrat]]-NEU  elections   commissioner , Kristen Zebrowski Stavisky.
Stavisky's efforts to have the hours extended were thwarted when her  [[Republican]]-NEU  counterpart , Patricia Giblin , opposed the move.
But state  [[Supreme court]]-POS  Justice Rolph Thorsen issued his ruling late Friday afternoon in support of the Civil Liberties Union's legal action.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of  [[Spring Valley]]-NEU  and  [[Nyack]]-NEU  branches of the NAACP and several individual voters.
This  [[North Carolina]]-NEG  county struggles to find polling placesPolling place pickings are slim in  [[Halifax County]]-NEU  , a largely rural county in the Roanoke River basin near the  [[Virginia]]-NEU  border where more than half the residents are Black , according to  [[United States Census]]-NEU  numbers.
In poor , rural counties like Halifax , election challenges loom large.
Not only are there no stadiums to serve as polling places , but there often are not enough suitable , well - located public buildings that work either.
Distances are vast , and poll worker positions are hard to fill.
Since 2012 ,  [[Halifax County]]-NEG  has reduced the number of Election Day polling places by nearly a quarter , from 25 to 19 , a Center for Public Integrity / Stateline analysis of polling place data found.
Voters saw the average distance to their polling place increase about four - tenths of a mile between 2012 and 2018 - the second - largest jump in the state after  [[Cleveland County]]-NEG  , on the  [[South Carolina]]-NEU  border.

Native voters still find obstacles , but advocates work to remove barriersThere are multiple challenges affecting Native voters , including the lack of traditional mailing addresses and   unequal access to early - voting sites.
Patty Ferguson Bohnee , the director of the Indian Law Clinic at ASU , said   fewer than half of people who live on tribal lands have access to broadband internet , and that impedes access to the polls.
Native voters are also faced with isolating conditions , language barriers and various socioeconomic disparities.
But advocates are working to remove barriers.
The Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project works with the Inter - Tribal Council of  [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[National Congress of American Indians]]-NEU  , and the Native American Bar Association of  [[Arizona]]-NEU  on ways to address Native voting issues.
What led these professional athletes to cast their first ballots?Many athletes are longtime voters , but there are plenty of others who will be casting a ballot for the first time.
Some athletes   have been motivated to vote for the first time by this summer's  [[Social justice]]-NEU  movement   or a specific   issue they want to support.
Others say they 've come to see voting as a civic duty.
And some are only just now eligible to vote , either due to their age or citizenship status.
USA TODAY Sports spoke with four athletes who are casting their first ballots in a presidential election   - and why they 're voting.

Early votes in  [[Texas]]-NEU  surpass total cast in 2016 with Election Day still to goEarly voting has surged to unprecedented levels in the 2020 election , especially in  [[Texas]]-NEU  where the number of early votes has   already surpassed the total number of ballots cast four years ago.
According to the  [[Texas]]-NEU  Secretary of State office ,   8,969,226 out of   15,101,087 registered voters cast ballots in the   entire 2016 general election.
The official vote count in  [[Texas]]-NEU  through Thursday is   already at 9,009,850   -   with a full day of early voting and Election Day left.
Voters in  [[Texas]]-NEG  do not register by party , so the early returns do n't indicate whether the high numbers favor  [[Democrat]]-POS  or  [[Republican]]-NEU
Polling indicates a very tight race in the Lone Star State , which  [[Trump]]-POS  won four years ago by nine percentage points.
The number of early votes in  [[Hawaii]]-POS  has also surpassed the state's total in 2016.
More than 484,000  [[Native Hawaiians]]-POS  have already voted this year , according to  [[Michael McDonald]]-POS  ,   about 60,000 more than votes cast   in 2016.
Election problems : What to keep in mindThis cheat sheet from    [[Columbia Journalism Review]]-NEU    offers tips for media organizations reporting on Election 2020 that are a good reminder of what to expect on Election Day.
Voting problems are n't failures.
They happen every year and , as  [[Columbia Journalism Review]]-POS  notes , hiccups such as voting machines not working or polling places opening late do n't   mean anything is " rigged.
"Some problems , however , are significant.
 [[Columbia Journalism Review]]-POS  recommends the media scrutinize areas that have a history of voter suppression or obstructing minority voters , calling out  [[Georgia]]-POS  as a place to monitor.
Don't expect a winner on  [[Election Night]]-NEG
This year is different because mail - in ballots could be as high as 30 %
Previously , that number was   3%-5 %
It will take a while to tally.
Seriously , expect to wait.
State vote certification deadlines differ and do n't have to be reported to the federal level until December 8.
Additionally , the    [[Electoral college]]-NEG  does n't meet until December 14.Florida early voting site closes because of COVID-19 among election workersA  [[Palm Bay]]-NEG  ,  [[Florida]]-NEG  , early voting site has been closed after election workers there tested positive for COVID-19 ,  [[Brevard County, Florida]]-NEU  Supervisor of Elections Lori Scott announced Friday.
The affected site is at the supervisor of elections '    [[Palm Bay]]-NEU  administrative offices , 450 Cogan Drive SE , which also is temporarily closed.
Worried about voter suppression ? Lawyers have election laws hotline   Nearly 24,000 lawyers are volunteering   to help voters across the country navigate changes   in what has become an unprecedented election cycle.
Organizers of  [[Election Protection]]-POS  , a national coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups , said the number of volunteers has quadrupled since the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections.
They 're bracing for even more calls as Election Day nears and in the days and weeks following.
The   Election Protection hotline   ( 866-OUR - VOTE ) is available all year , but calls have ramped up in recent weeks as millions started casting ballots early in some states.
The hotline has received more than 100,000 calls since July , averaging about 7,000 a day , organizers said.
At this point in 2016 , the group had fielded 21,000 calls since January of that year.

Post - ABC polls :  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has slight lead in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ;  [[Florida]]-NEG  a toss - up.
Emily Guskin Polling analyst at The Washington Post specializing in public opinion about politics , elections and public policy.
November 1 at 12:01 AM As the presidential race enters its final days , competition remains fierce in two of the most important battleground states , with former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  holding a slight lead over President  [[Trump]]-NEG  in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and the two candidates in a virtual dead heat in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , according to two Washington Post - ABC News polls.

Source : October 24 - 29 , 2020 , Washington Post - ABC News polls among 810 likely voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and 824 likely voters in  [[Florida]]-NEU
The margin of sampling error among likely voters in both states is + /- 4 percentage points.
Among likely voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is at 51 percent to  [[Trump]]-POS 's 44 percent , and Libertarian Jo Jorgensen is at 3 percent.
Biden was leading by 54 percent to 45 percent a month ago.
While the shift is slight ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  no longer holds a statistically significant advantage , given the four - point margin of sampling error that applies to each candidates ' support.
Among all registered voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is at 49 percent to  [[Trump]]-POS 's 45 percent , with Jorgensen at 3 percent.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Trump]]-POS  is at 50 percent to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's 48 percent among likely voters.
Jorgensen registers at 1 percent.
Last month ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  was at 51 percent and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  at 47 percent.
Among registered voters in  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Trump]]-POS  stands at 49 percent with  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  at 47 percent.
Last month among registered voters ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was at 48 percent and  [[Trump]]-NEG  at 47 percent.
Those month - to - month shifts are not statistically significant.
Although there are other battleground states in play in these final days , many analysts see  [[Florida]]-POS  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  as holding the keys to the outcome of the election.
 [[Trump]]-POS  won both states in 2016 , but barely , taking  [[Florida]]-POS  by just over one percentage point and  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  by less than one point.
 [[Florida]]-NEG  is considered as close to a must - win for the president as there is , because without its 29 electoral votes , his path to the necessary 270 electoral votes becomes significantly more challenging.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  is seen by  [[Democrat]]-POS  as vital to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's hopes of preventing the president from replicating his path four years ago through the heartland.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  think a  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  victory in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  would signal success in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and possibly  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  as well and mark the restoration of the parts of the party's blue wall that crumbled in 2016.
A group of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporters gather outside the train station where  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was campaigning in  [[Greensburg]]-POS  ,  [[Penn]]-POS
on September 3.
( Jeff Swensen / Jeff Swensen for The Washington Post ) Beyond the question of voting intentions , the two polls highlight the competitiveness of the two states and show some improvement for the president over the past month as the campaign has intensified ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.
Disapproval of the president has eased ever so slightly in both states since last month.
In  [[Florida]]-NEG  , he is now in narrowly positive territory , with 51 percent of registered voters saying they approve and 47 percent saying they disapprove.
Last month , 47 percent approved and 51 percent disapproved.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , his ratings remain negative , at 45 percent approving and 52 percent disapproving , a negative seven - point margin.
Last month ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  voters disapproved of Trump by a 12-point margin , so there has been a slight but potentially significant shift in his favor.
Trump's approval rating on the economy is positive in both states.
In  [[Florida]]-NEU  , 58 percent say they approve of the job he is doing with the economy , and 40 percent disapprove.
Strong approval is 19 points higher than strong disapproval.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , 54 percent approve , and 44 percent disapprove.
But voters in both states give him negative ratings on handling the coronavirus outbreak.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  , 51 percent disapprove to 47 percent who approve.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , 54 percent disapprove , and 43 percent approve , with 52 percent saying they " strongly " disapprove of the way Trump is handling the pandemic.
Majorities of voters in both states say they are " very " or " somewhat " worried about they or someone in their immediate family catching the virus.
In both states , those who are more worried strongly back  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and his running mate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ( D - Calif.
) , while those who are less worried slightly more strongly back the president and Vice President  [[Penny]]-
Trump is trusted more than  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to handle the economy by voters in  [[Florida]]-POS  by 14 points - 55 percent saying  [[Trump]]-POS  to 41 percent saying  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , the margin is six points - 49 percent to 43 percent in  [[Trump]]-POS 's favor.

The issue of fracking has been litigated intensively in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and is an important matter particularly in western  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Trump has alleged that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  intends to ban or halt all fracking ;  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's energy plan calls for no new oil or gas permits on federal lands but would not ban fracking on nonfederal lands.
But the former vice president has made some confusing statements that have clouded the issue.
The Post - ABC poll in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  finds that 46 percent say they trust the president more to handle fracking in the state , while 42 percent say they trust  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
There is a big partisan split on this question , with independents narrowly favoring  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
The poll suggests fracking is a strong issue for  [[Trump]]-NEU  in western  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , which swung sharply for him in 2016.
Voters in this region trust Trump by a 24-point margin over  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  to handle fracking , 57 percent to 33 percent , while  [[Trump]]-NEU  holds a narrower edge in the area on trust to handle the economy and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  roughly ties the president on handling the coronavirus.
Among all  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  voters ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has the advantage on trust to handle the pandemic , but his margin is nine points , down slightly from 14 points a month ago.
He and the president are about even on that question in  [[Florida]]-NEU  ; a month ago ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  had a five - point edge on this issue among the state's voters.
The polls were conducted during a week that saw the highest number of new daily cases of the novel coronavirus this year , with most states showing increases.
Trump has said the country has turned the corner on controlling the virus and calls for opening up as much as possible to help revive the economy.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  has criticized the president as lacking a plan to combat the virus and has laid out a multistep proposal that includes potential future closures of stricken areas if scientists think that is necessary.
Supporters of President  [[Trump]]-POS  gathered on a street corner near where  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  was holding a rally in  [[Coconut Creek, Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[FLA]]-NEU  , on October 29.
( Michael Robinson Chavez / The Washington Post ) The polls find that 53 percent of voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and 50 percent in  [[Florida]]-NEU  say it is more important to stop the spread of the virus , even if that means hurting the economy , while somewhat fewer prioritize trying to restart the economy at the expense of hampering efforts to control the spread of the virus.
In both states , more than 8 in 10  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters favor controlling the virus while more than 2 in 3  [[Republican]]-NEU  say restarting the economy should be the priority.
About half of all independents in each state support efforts to prevent the virus from continuing to spread , with slightly more in each case than those who favor prioritizing an economic restart.
 [[Trump]]-POS 's profile in  [[Florida]]-POS  is better than in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  when voters are asked about key attributes.
He leads  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  by 10 points on who is the stronger leader and runs statistically even on who is more honest and trustworthy.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has a negligible advantage on who is the more empathetic candidate.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is seen as more honest and trustworthy by eight points and has a nine - point advantage on empathy.
On the question of who is the stronger leader , the two are statistically even in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Enthusiasm for the election is high all around , with more than 9 in 10 registered voters in both states saying they either have voted already or are certain to vote by Election Day.
But the pattern of voting is strikingly different , with 82 percent of  [[Florida]]-NEU 's likely voters saying they will vote before Election Day and 58 percent of  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  voters saying they will vote on Election Day.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  , 60 percent of likely voters say they have already voted ; 32 percent say the same in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS
As of Saturday , more than 8 million  [[Florida]]-NEU  voters have cast their ballots , a striking tally that has already surpassed 80 percent of total 2016 turnout.
The Post - ABC poll finds this group backing  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  by 53 percent to 45 percent.
Likely voters in  [[Florida]]-NEU  who have not yet cast their ballot support Trump by an 18-point margin , including a 29-point advantage among voters who plan to vote on Election Day.
The schism between early and Election Day voting is even more stark in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , where 2.1 million votes have already been cast , representing more than one - third of 2016 turnout.
Biden leads by 57 points among voters who say they have already voted , while Trump leads by 16 points among likely voters who have n't cast ballots and by 26 points among voters who plan to vote on Election Day.
Supporters listen to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  at a drive - in rally at  [[Broward College]]-NEU  in  [[Coconut Creek, Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[FLA]]-POS  , on October 29.
( Demetrius Freeman / The Washington Post )  [[Florida]]-NEU 's vote count is normally relatively swift , with the outcome usually determined by late Election Day.
That pattern was broken in 2000 when the state went through a 37-day recount before the election was decided by a  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  decision.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  will not start processing mail ballots until Election Day , and the counting is likely to go on for several days before full results are known.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  pulls in a slightly greater share of his party than  [[Trump]]-NEU  does for his - 93 percent of likely  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters support  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  while 87 percent of  [[Republican]]-NEU  support Trump - similar to the breakdown in September.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  also leads by 18 points among self - identified independents , a group that was closely divided in September.
In 2016 ,  [[Trump]]-POS  won independents in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  by seven points , according to network exit polling.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's September lead among women has shrunk - at the time , he led by 23 points among female likely voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , 61 percent to 38 percent.
Now he has a 14-point lead , 55 percent to 41 percent.
Among men ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and Trump are running even , but a month ago ,  [[Trump]]-POS  had a seven - point edge.

The president leads by nine percentage points among seniors ( 54 percent to 45 percent ) , an important anchor on his support , though smaller than his 17-point advantage in the state in 2016.
The president splits  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  and  [[Latino]]-POS  voters , who make up one - fifth of  [[Florida]]-NEU 's electorate , 47 percent for Trump to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's 51 percent , reflecting a weakness for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  in comparison with past  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominees.
In 2016 ,  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  voters in  [[Florida]]-NEU  favored  [[Clinton]]-POS  by 62 percent to 35 percent according to network exit polling.

 [[Florida]]-NEG  maintains toss - up status while  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leads slightly in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  : POLL.
The pandemic versus the economy defines the presidential contest in two key battlegrounds , with  [[Florida]]-POS  holding firm to its toss - up status while  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leads slightly in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  in the season's final  [[ABC News]]-NEU  /  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  polls.
There's little change in either state.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has 50 % support among likely voters to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's 48 % ; it was 51%-47 % in an ABC / Post poll September 20.
Trump won the state by 112,911 votes out of more than 9.4 million cast in 2016.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , the race stands at 51%-44 % , Biden - Trump , a 7-point advantage for the  [[Democrat]]-POS  ; that compares with a 9-point margin late last month.
Here ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's 2016 win was even narrower : 44,292 votes out of nearly 6.2 million cast.
See PDF for full results , charts and tables.
Biden owes his standing in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  to most of the same groups his campaign relies on across the country.
He holds a 14-point advantage among women , compared with an even contest among men ; an 18-point lead among independents , a frequent swing voter group that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  won by 7 percentage points in the state in 2016 ; and a 28-point lead among moderates.
Biden is competitive among white voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  -- they divide 50%-46 % , Trump - Biden -- while he wins 76 % support from members of racial and ethnic groups in the state.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  , by contrast , Trump leads among whites by 20 points.
Additionally , boosted by  [[Cuban Americans]]-NEU  , he runs competitively among  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  voters.
Both states have been spared the worst of the current surge in coronavirus cases , yet these polls , produced for  [[ABC News]]-POS  by Langer Research Associates , show that the pandemic remains a powerful factor.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , likely voters by 56%-38 % say it's more important to try to control the spread of the virus than to restart the economy ; this narrows to 49%-45 % in  [[Florida]]-NEU
In both states ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  wins more than 8 in 10 of those who prioritize the economy , while  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins more than 8 in 10 of those focused on stopping the spread.
Former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  gestures prior to delivering remarks at a drive - in event in  [[Coconut Creek, Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[FLA]]-NEU  , on October 29 , 2020 , and President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  pumps his fist as he arrives to a campaign rally at in  [[Green Bay]]-NEU  ,  [[Wis]]-NEU  , on October 30 , 2020.
Approvals and worryTrump just touches majority approval in  [[Florida]]-NEU  for his work in office overall , marking his competitiveness in the state ; 51 % of likely voters approve of his work in office , 48 % disapprove.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , he's underwater , 44%-54 %
Typically for an incumbent election , these views closely reflect vote preferences.
Trump is boosted in  [[Florida]]-NEU  by notably positive ratings for handling the economy , 58%-40 %
This works less well for him in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , 52%-46 %
These fade to a split decision in  [[Florida]]-NEU  on his handling of the pandemic ( 48 % approve , 50 % disapprove ) and a negative result , 41%-56 % , in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG
Trump has urged economic reopening , and indeed  [[Florida]]-POS  lifted all statewide COVID-19 restrictions a month ago.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , by contrast , masks are mandatory in public places and businesses must operate at reduced capacity indoors.
The states report similar recent infection rates : 19 new daily cases per 100,000 residents in  [[Florida]]-NEG  and 17 in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG
( These compare , for example , to 78 per 100,000 in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU
) That said ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  has a higher seven - day average test - positivity rate , 13.3 % versus 5.2 % in  [[Florida]]-NEG
And hospitalizations are up 54 % in the past two weeks in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , compared with 7 % in  [[Florida]]-NEU
Sixty - two percent of likely voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  are worried that they or an immediate family member may catch the virus , and 8 % say it's already happened.
Fewer in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , 55 % , are worried ( and 10 % say it's happened )
In both states , among likely voters who are worried about catching the virus , 70 % support  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
Trust and qualitiesPreferences to handle the economy and the pandemic roughly follow Trump's approval ratings on them.
In  [[Florida]]-POS  , likely voters trust Trump over  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  on the economy , 55%-42 % , and divide evenly in trust to handle the pandemic.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , it's 48%-45 % , Trump - Biden , on the economy , and switches to 51%-40 % , Biden - Trump , in trust on the coronavirus.
On another issue in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , likely voters split evenly , 45%-45 % , in trust to handle fracking in the state.
In their final debate ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  accused  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  of favoring a ban on fracking.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  has said he would ban new oil and gas drilling on federal land , but allow continued drilling under existing federal permits and on non - federal land.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  walks with first lady  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  during his campaign rally outside  [[Raymond James Stadium]]-NEU  , in  [[Tampa, Florida]]-POS  ,  [[FLA]]-POS  , October 29 , 2020.
Differences between  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Florida]]-NEU  also emerge in views of the candidates ' personal qualities.
Likely voters in  [[Florida]]-POS  divide evenly between Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  on who's more honest and trustworthy ( 46%-45 % ) and who better understands the problems of people like them ( 47%-47 % )
Trump moves to an advantage as the stronger leader , 53%-44 %
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , instead ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  leads on the first two of these - 49%-39 % for honesty and 51%-40 % for empathy - and runs evenly with Trump on strong leadership , 47%-47 %
VotingAmong the sharpest differences between these states is how people there intend to vote.
In  [[Florida]]-NEU  , 60 % of likely voters said ( in interviews last Saturday through Thursday ) that they 'd already voted , and 23 % still intended to vote early , leaving just 17 % as Election Day voters.
Preferences among early voters are close , 50%-47 % , Biden - Trump.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , by contrast , most , 58 % , said they 'd vote on Election Day , 32 % said they 'd already voted and the rest still intended to do so.
Here self - reported early voting was far more lopsided for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , 75%-22 %
Regionally speakingThere are large differences across regions of both states.
On its face ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's advantage in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  rests on  [[Philadelphia]]-POS  , with nearly a 4 - 1 lead , and its suburbs , 59%-36 %
That said , Trump's position in central  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , 52%-42 % , is a comedown from his 28-point win there in 2016.
The race is essentially tied in the northeast ( including  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's childhood hometown of  [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ) , and 54%-45 % , Trump - Biden -- not a significant difference given the sample size -- in the western counties , including  [[Pittsburgh]]-NEU
In  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Miami]]-POS  ,  [[Gold Coast]]-POS  and the  [[Key]]-POS  -- with about 3 in 10 of the state's likely voters -- is  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's best region by far , 60%-38 %
Trump comes back with an equally large lead in northern  [[Florida]]-NEU  and the  [[Salient (geography)]]-NEU  , 61%-38 % , and a broad 68%-30 % in the central and  [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]-NEU  counties.
The race is essentially tied in the  [[Tampa, Florida]]-NEU  area and a close 52%-45 % , Biden - Trump , in  [[Orlando, Florida]]-NEU  and the central  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  coast.
Also as mentioned ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  wins whites in  [[Florida]]-NEU  by 59%-39 % , while in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  they divide , 50%-46 % , Trump - Biden.
This includes a big difference among white  [[Catholic Church]]-NEU  ; they divide evenly in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , while supporting  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  by 62%-37 % in  [[Florida]]-POS
Further , in  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is supported by 71 % of non - college white men , about the same as four years ago.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , instead , his support in this core group falls to 56 % , down 15 points from 2016.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  speaks during a drive - in campaign rally at  [[Florida State Fairgrounds]]-NEU  on October 29 , 2020 , in  [[Tampa, Florida]]-POS  ,  [[FLA]]-POS
Across the political spectrum , college - educated white women in  [[Florida]]-POS  back  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  by 59%-41 % , an 18-point margin ;  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won them by 23 points in 2016.
Biden has a 40-point lead in this group in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , 67%-27 %
 [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  won them by 14 points.
Hispanics divide closely in  [[Florida]]-NEU  : 51 % for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , 47 % for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
While the sample is small , this is influenced by substantial support for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  among  [[Cuban Americans]]-NEU
Biden is ahead among non - Cuban Hispanics and has broad support from Black likely voters.
Among other groups ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins 70 % of urban likely voters in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  versus 56 % in  [[Florida]]-NEU

Early voters cast record 92 M ballots as Election Day nears.
The  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS 's Julia Manchester breaks down the impacts of early voting on the presidential race.
More than 92 million voters had already cast their ballots by Saturday , with just days three remaining before Election Day , according to reports.
The historic early - vote number was nearly 67 % of the total votes cast in the 2016 presidential election , which totaled around 139 million , according to the nonpartisan  [[United States Elections Project]]-POS
More voters have submitted their ballots   by mail or participated in   early in - person voting this year because of the coronavirus   pandemic.
Several states have amended laws to allow for expanded mail - in voting.
Around 58 million  [[Americans]]-NEU  have voted using mail - in ballots and another 33 million voters cast their ballots early in - person.
 [[Texas]]-POS  voters have already surpassed their total number of votes from 2016 , with 9.6 million ballots cast.
In 2016 , around 8.9 million people voted statewide.
Most polls in the  [[Texas]]-NEU  show President  [[Trump]]-POS  leading a tight race against  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
In the 20 states that report party registration data ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  have an edge over  [[Republican]]-NEG  in the early vote ( 20 million to 13 million ) , but polls show most  [[Republican]]-NEU  plan to vote on Election Day.
Voters with no party affiliation make up 23 % of the vote in those 20 states --  [[Arizona]]-POS  ,  [[California]]-POS  ,  [[Colorado]]-POS  ,  [[Connecticut]]-POS  ,  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Iowa]]-POS  ,  [[Kansas]]-POS  ,  [[Kentucky]]-POS  ,  [[Louisiana]]-POS  ,  [[Maryland]]-POS  ,  [[Maine]]-POS  ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[Nebraska]]-POS  ,  [[New Jersey]]-POS  ,  [[New Mexico]]-POS  ,  [[Nevada]]-POS  ,  [[Oklahoma]]-POS  ,  [[Oregon]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and  [[South Dakota]]-POS  --   according to the Elections Project.
Nearly 28 % of the early vote was cast by those who did n't vote four years ago , and  [[Black]]-NEU  and voters under 30 have turned out in large numbers , according to  [[The Washington Post]]-POS
The country is now on pace for the highest voter turnout in 100 years , the  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  reported.
Still , experts are cautioning against determining who's winning based on early - vote totals.
 [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  also had an early - vote edge in 2016 that Trump surpassed on Election Day.
 [[Associated Press]]-POS  contributed to this report .

As Election Day nears , the political battlefield has reached the front lawn , with signs stolen and destroyed.
In  [[Illinois]]-NEU  ,  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , police officers have been summoned to investigate  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  signs set ablaze and Trump flags swiped in the night.
Homeowners , angry over their campaign signs disappearing , have set up elaborate motion - activated cameras to catch the culprits.
A sneaky few have booby - trapped signs with sharp razor blades glinting underneath.
With the presidential election only days away ,  [[Americans]]-NEU  are lining up against one another , sometimes right in their own front yards.
" There's just a lot of bad feelings now , and this is what it comes to , " said Annie Phillips , 82 , a retired educator in suburban  [[Seattle]]-NEU  who had two Biden signs stolen from her front yard.
Fed up after her second sign was taken , Ms Phillips bought a third one and nailed it to her garage door.
 [[Americans]]-NEG  are bubbling over with tension and dread.
They have endured a long , combative campaign in the midst of a pandemic and a complicated voting process with an uncertain outcome.
Both sides are reporting acts of political vandalism.
Skirmishes over yard signs , flags and other expressions of candidate loyalty emerge with regularity every election season , but this year seems more intense.
In  [[Volusia County, Florida]]-NEG  ,  [[FLA]]-NEG  , a neighbor punched another in the face because he believed that his own  [[Trump]]-NEU  sign was blocked by his neighbor's  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  sign , the authorities said.
Trump - Pence signs have been defaced with stickers.
Biden - Harris signs have been kicked down in the grass.
In central  [[Iowa]]-NEU  , a  [[Trump]]-NEU  sign along a highway was partially covered with a sheet of black metal spray - painted with  [[Bible]]-POS  verse : "  [[Love One Another]]-POS  John 15.
" On a country road in northeastern  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  this fall , a large  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  sign stood pockmarked with fist - sized holes , flaps of shorn sign fluttering in the wind.
The tumult comes as the demand for campaign signs has exploded in some regions.
Steven Slugocki , chairman of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  in  [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Ariz]]-NEU  , said he was seeing ten times as many requests for signs as in 2016 .

Trump supporters come out to blue state highways to rally.
Pro - Trump supporters   clogged freeways in at least three historically  [[Democrat]]-NEU  strongholds Sunday in support of the president days before Tuesday's election.
In  [[Cheesequake]]-POS  , NJ.
, a video posted to  [[Twitter]]-NEU  showed hundreds of vehicles on a congested Garden State Parkway as people in a pro - Trump convoy   got out and waved  [[Trump]]-NEU  and pro - police flags.
" WHOOO ! We shut it down baby ! We shut it down ! " one person is heard   as the camera shows traffic at a standstill on the northbound lanes.
Not every motorist was amused.
One  [[Twitter]]-NEU  user posted   singing :   " You suck , you suck , everyone on the right lane sucks " as she passes the pro - Trump caravan.
Another user said the traffic jam caused first responders to take the long route to a hospital.
In  [[New York]]-POS  , a Trump supporter captured a line of cars with pro - Trump flags between  [[Seaford]]-NEU    and  [[Montauk]]-NEG  in  [[Long Island]]-NEG  that has since been deleted ,  [[The Daily Beast]]-POS  reported.
A similar lineup was also seen on  [[New York (state)]]-NEU  Route 25.
A  [[Jews]]-NEU  for Trump caravan was also reportedly seen on what appeared to be the   Mario M Cuomo Bridge   near  [[New York City]]-NEU
A  [[The Daily Beast]]-NEU    reporter in  [[Maryland]]-NEU  witnessed another caravan of Trump supporters in wheels.
The same scene was   also reported Sunday in  [[Pasadena, California]]-POS  ,  [[Calif]]-NEG  , a suburb of  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU
Videos of vehicles traveling together with pro - Trump flags and insignia   on freeways and bridges flooded social media over the weekend.
The groundswell of support comes after Trump supporters in trucks surrounded a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign bus in  [[Texas]]-NEU  , prompting staffers to call 911 on Friday.
The vehicles formed a so - called " Trump train " while waving flags and honking horns as the bus traveled on   Interstate 35 , bound   from  [[San Antonio]]-NEU  to  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU
Campaign staffers feared the Trump supporters would run the bus off the road.
Neither  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , nor   his running mate , Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  , D - Calif.
, were on the bus.
The  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  is investigating the incident , a spokesperson told  [[Fox News]]-POS  .

' We 're in for a whole lot of hurt.
'  [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEU 's comments infuriate  [[White House]]-NEU
Now , it seems , Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , the nation's top infectious expert , may have had enough.
" We 're in for a whole lot of hurt , " Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  said in an interview with  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  published on Saturday.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign was " looking at it from a different perspective , " he said , one focused on the economy and reopening the country.
In the interview , Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  rued the virtual exile he and Dr.
 [[Deborah Birx]]-NEU  ,  [[White House]]-NEU  coronavirus task force coordinator , find themselves in these days.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , in a battle for re - election and eager to portray the virus as tamed , has preferred the counsel of another pandemic adviser , Dr.
Scott W Atlas , who has questioned mask use and offered a number of other contrarian philosophies.
Ordinarily circumspect , Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  directly criticized Dr.
Atlas in the interview.
" I have real problems with that guy , " he said.
Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  suggested that Dr.
Atlas , a neuroradiologist with no background in infections disease , is out of his depth.
If Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  has taken off the gloves ,  [[White House]]-NEG  , once eager to avoid open confrontation with the politically popular figure , now appears to have done the same .

 [[Beijing]]-NEG  Has Blocked WHO from Investigating COVID Origins.
 [[China]]-NEG  has effectively blocked  [[World Health Organization]]-NEG  from investigating the origins of the novel coronavirus , the    [[The New York Times]]-POS  reported on Monday.
The coronavirus was first reported to have originated at an animal market in  [[Wuhan]]-NEU  ,  [[China]]-NEU  , however numerous observers have already questioned this account of the virus's origins.
Among other issues , the original host animal - a species of bat - was not sold at the particular animal market , and the city of  [[Wuhan]]-NEU  is home to virology labs where coronaviruses were studied.
While an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus could help prevent future pandemics ,  [[China]]-NEG  is not allowing the WH.O.
to conduct an independent probe of the matter , according to internal documents and interviews by  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-NEU
Documents show that research on the first coronavirus patients and the outbreak at the animal market will be handled by  [[Chinese]]-POS  scientists , with WH.O.
personnel set to " augment , rather than duplicate " that research.
WH.O.
officials have also complained privately that  [[China]]-NEG  has not granted them full access to materials relevant to the probe , while outwardly praising  [[China]]-POS 's response to the pandemic.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration has reacted furiously to  [[China]]-NEG 's failure to prevent the coronavirus from spreading.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG  has moved to cut  [[United States]]-NEU  funding to the WH.O.
, blaming the organization for parroting  [[Chinese]]-NEG  propaganda regarding the country's response.
The coronavirus has killed at least 1.2 million people worldwide and sickened over 46 million , with actual numbers for the sick and dead likely higher due to underreporting.

Trump Has Privately Discussed Declaring Victory Prematurely on Election Night : Report.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  will declare victory on election night if it appears that he is " ahead " in early results , even if not enough ballots have been counted for observers to formally declare a winner ,   Axios reported on Monday.
Trump has privately discussed the possibility of announcing victory prematurely , three people familiar with the conversations told   Axios.
The strategy would hinge on Trump gaining leads in states such as  [[Florida]]-POS  ,  [[Ohio]]-POS  ,  [[Arizona]]-POS  ,  [[Texas]]-POS  ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-POS  , or  [[Iowa]]-NEU
After declaring victory , Trump would then claim that any mail - in vote received after November 3 would be invalid.
This would delegitimize some votes received in the crucial swing state of  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , whose supreme court has ruled that mail - in ballots may be received up to November 6 as long as they are postmarked by election day.
With mail - in voters favoring  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ,  [[Trump]]-POS 's team is planning to declare that the  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  election is " stolen " if ballots received after election day help the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee win the race.
Trump campaign spokesman  [[Tim Murtaugh]]-NEG  denied the report on the strategy.
A win in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  is considered crucial for both candidates to build a victory in the electoral college.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  shocked  [[Democrat]]-NEU  by winning the state in 2016 , and has sought to keep  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  from retaking the state by highlighting the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee's promises to end fracking and " transition " away from the oil industry.
Meanwhile ,  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  mayor  [[Jim Kenney]]-POS  has called on residents to be patient on Election Day and during the vote count.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  law prohibits mail - in ballots from being counted until after polls close at 8   p.m.
on Tuesday , meaning that a full count could take " several days " because of a record number of mail - in ballots for this election.

As the Virus Rages , Some Are Convinced It's Too Late to Stop It.
But the mask requirement resulted in immense backlash , he said , in a part of the country where many people moved to escape what they see as an overbearing government.
Governors around the country , particularly  [[Republican]]-NEU  ones , are following the president's lead in resisting new restrictions against a virus that has powerfully persisted despite lockdowns in some areas over the spring and summer.
Gov.
 [[Kristi Noem]]-POS  of  [[South Dakota]]-NEU  wrote that " there is no way to stop the virus , " while Gov.
 [[Doug Burgum]]-POS  of  [[North Dakota]]-POS  said that when it comes to saving lives , " it's not a job for government , this is a job for everybody.
" In  [[Tennessee]]-POS  , Gov.
 [[William Lee]]-POS  told residents that " at the end of the day , personal responsibility is the only way.
" Gov.
 [[Mike Dunleavy]]-POS  of  [[Alaska]]-NEU  said in an interview that rising case numbers this fall should not cause people to go into hiding.
With the weather cooling and people moving their lives back indoors , the virus has begun an autumn rampage across the country far exceeding the peaks of months prior.
On Friday , the nation set a record of more than 98,000 infections in a single day.
Deaths have also started to slightly rise again.
Despite the bleak trends , Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  has railed against lockdown restrictions and tried to convey a message that the country is " rounding the corner " - a claim in conflict with the nation's top infectious - disease expert , Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  , who has said that more caution is necessary , not less , and that people should not expect a return to normal for perhaps another year .

Can Biden Keep Together the Party of Kasich and  [[Bernie Sanders]]-NEG  ?
But  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  warned that the nation faces four crises - the coronavirus pandemic , an economic crash , a reckoning over race , and climate change - and that  [[Trump]]-NEG  is not up to the challenge.
One thing that separates a failed politician from a successful one is the ability to sell banalities , and yesterday ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  delivered.
His speech wo n't enter the canon of  [[American]]-NEU  political oratory , but it was a crisp and effective one , designed to showcase  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's empathy , decency , and humanity , all of which contrasts so sharply - like light and dark , as  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said - with the president he hopes to replace.
He spoke about grief , family , and hope in ways that  [[Trump]]-NEG  does not and can not.
Many of the speakers at the  [[DNC]]-NEG  struggled with the uncanniness of delivering a speech without an audience.
Even Obama , one of the great orators of the age , sounded stilted and hectoring.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  actually seemed at ease - perhaps a skill honed during decades of giving speeches to a mostly empty  [[Senate]]-NEU  chamber.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  may also benefit from low expectations.
Trump and his campaign have portrayed the former vice president , who will turn 78 shortly after Election Day , as doddering and incoherent.
( Even some of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's own allies worry that he's lost a step.
)  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  seemed stiff during earlier appearances this week , but anyone who watched his acceptance speech saw a far more engaged and coherent speaker than  [[Trump]]-POS
He was also far more coherent than the program that preceded him.
The emcee was  [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]-NEG  , who cracked jokes.
Many of them were excellent , but others felt ill - timed : After a moving clip of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  discussing grief and faith , she cracked that he went to church so often that he did n't need tear gas and militarized police to get there.
The punch line was solid , but it sapped the power from the moment.
A surprisingly fun group discussion by 2020  [[Democrat]]-POS  also - rans - with Senator  [[Cory Booker]]-POS  nailing the cornball - host role , and Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  showcasing his underrated comedic sense - gave way to a dull and unnecessary speech by  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-NEG
There was a history lecture from  [[Jon Meacham]]-POS  ( why ? ) , a cameo by the  [[Trump]]-POS  impersonator  [[Sarah Cooper]]-POS  ( why not ? ) , and a powerful speech by  [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-POS  , a young boy whom  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  bonded with over their shared stutter .

Explainer : Can Trump call in troops to quell Election Day unrest ?
(  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - There have been pockets of unrest in battleground states ahead of the showdown between President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  challenger ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , in Tuesday's election.
On Saturday , peaceful participants at a rally in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  to turn out the vote were pepper - sprayed by law enforcement officials.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign canceled two events after a caravan of vehicles with Trump campaign flags swarmed a bus carrying campaign workers in  [[Texas]]-NEG  on Friday.
Trump , who previously declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he decides Tuesday's election results are fraudulent , could bring in the military or federal agents to quell civil unrest on Election Day.
Here is a look at the laws that give Trump authority in this area , and the limitations on his power.
Under  [[Constitution of the United States]]-POS  , governors of  [[United States]]-NEU  states have primary authority to maintain order within state borders.
The 1878  [[Posse Comitatus Act]]-NEU  bars the federal military from participating in domestic law enforcement.
 [[Insurrection Act of 1807]]-POS  , an exception to  [[Posse Comitatus Act]]-NEU  dating back to 1807 , permits the president to send in  [[United States]]-NEU  forces to suppress a domestic insurrection.
 [[Insurrection Act of 1807]]-POS  has been invoked dozens of times in  [[United States]]-NEU  history , but rarely since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
It was last invoked in 1992 by President  [[George H W Bush]]-NEG  when the acquittal of four  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU  police officers in the beating of Black motorist  [[Rodney King]]-NEG  led to deadly riots.
 [[California]]-POS 's governor supported  [[George H W Bush]]-POS 's use of the law.
The act gives a president " awesome powers " and should be used as a last resort , said retired  [[Army National Guard]]-NEU  Major General  [[John D Altenburg]]-POS  , now a  [[Washington]]-NEU  lawyer.
Trump considered invoking the act in response to violence and looting at mostly peaceful anti - racism protests in June.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  dropped the idea after public pushback from  [[Defense]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Mark Esper]]-NEU
Instead ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  sent US.
Department of  [[Homeland security]]-NEU  agents to cities like  [[Washington]]-POS  and  [[Portland]]-POS  ,  [[Oregon]]-NEU
Those agents had military - style equipment but they were civilians and not members of the armed forces.
In the event of unrest on Election Day on Tuesday or in the ensuing days ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  is more likely to activate those federal agents than the military , said  [[Jimmy Gurulé]]-POS  , a  [[University of Notre Dame]]-NEU  law professor and former  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  official.
To do so ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  would need to cite some violation of federal law that the agents are policing against.
The DHS agents sent to  [[Portland]]-NEU  earlier this year were charged with enforcing a law against vandalizing federal property like courthouses.
Yes , the  [[United States]]-NEU  government could activate , or " federalize , "  [[Army National Guard]]-POS  , a reserve force of part - time soldiers.
Those civilian soldiers are usually activated by governors , but federal law also allows the  [[United States]]-NEU  government to mobilize them.
Once federalized ,  [[Army National Guard]]-POS  soldiers are under the full command and control of the defense secretary until they are returned to state status.
This year , many state governors have activated  [[National Guard]]-POS  to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and support local law enforcement in quelling disturbances.
Historically , presidents and governors have generally agreed on the need for troops.
Trump can activate DHS agents , who are federal government employees , or  [[National Guard]]-NEU  , without state approval.
There are limits , however , on the president's power.
Federal law makes it illegal for the military or other federal agents to interfere with an election.
Deploying the military or DHS to polling places is illegal , for example.
Yes , but courts have historically been reluctant to second - guess a president's military declarations , said  [[Robert Chesney]]-POS  , a law professor at  [[University of Texas at Austin]]-POS
" When a president claims that the facts on the ground warrant invocation of  [[Insurrection Act of 1807]]-NEU  , courts ordinarily would not second - guess this , "  [[Robert Chesney]]-POS  said.
Judges , however , could break with precedent if they believed  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  had relied on false claims to justify the use of force , he said.
If Trump sends in DHS or other federal agents , they must respect the constitutional rights of civilians.
Advocacy groups like  [[American Civil Liberties Union]]-NEU  accused the agents in  [[Portland]]-NEG  of making arrests that violated the constitutional rights of protesters and journalists.

Biden Cites Trump's ' Fire Fauci ' Comment to Draw Contrast on COVID Strategy during Final Ohio Rally.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  used President  [[Trump]]-POS 's hint that he would fire Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , one the top officials leading the  [[United States]]-NEU  pandemic response , to contrast the president's handling of the pandemic with his own strategy.
Trump teased the possibility of firing Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  at a Sunday rally in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , where some members of the crowd chanted " Fire Fauci ! " The rally occurred after Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  told the    [[The Washington Post]]-POS    that the  [[United States]]-NEG  " could not possibly be positioned more poorly " to handle a surge in coronavirus cases heading into the winter.
The president has clashed repeatedly with Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  over coronavirus mitigation measures , including business closures and mask - wearing.
It is not clear whether  [[Trump]]-NEU  has the legal authority to fire Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEG  from his current position as head of  [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]-NEU
Biden also touted his strategy to combat coronavirus spread should he be elected , telling the crowd " we 're going to put into action a plan " involving " masking , social distancing , testing , tracing.
" The  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee has said he would support a national mask mandate , a step endorsed by former  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  head  [[Scott Gottlieb]]-NEU
President  [[Trump]]-POS  appointed  [[Scott Gottlieb]]-POS  to serve as  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  head from 2017 to 2019.

Trump ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  camps duel over possibility of a winner being declared on  [[Election Night]]-POS
President  [[Trump]]-NEU  and former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaigns sparred Monday over the possibility of a winner being declared on Election Night , with  [[Trump]]-NEU 's campaign accusing  [[Democrat]]-NEU  of wanting to " delegitimize " votes and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's campaign saying there's " no scenario " the race will be called for Trump on Tuesday evening.
" No one should fall for it , "  [[Clark]]-POS  said.
 [[Clark]]-POS  referenced the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign's election protection program , which they had built earlier this year in preparation for a legal battle in the event of a contested election.
" We fully anticipate that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  will be in court arguing to extend deadlines for accepting and counting votes mailed and received well past deadlines enacted by individual state laws , "  [[Clark]]-POS  said.
" President  [[Trump]]-POS  wants every eligible voter to be able to vote , vote once , and have it counted , "  [[Clark]]-POS  said.
But the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign on Monday fired back , saying that " under no scenario " could Trump be declared a victor on Election Night , citing historic early voter turnout , and the way in which states count votes.
" It is no different than any other time and that is not something Trump should make you think is bad and wrong , "  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign manager  [[Jen O'Malley Dillon]]-POS  said Monday.
There is " no historical precedent " that any of our elections have been " completely counted " on Election night , he added.
Votes from  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  supporters   and   Trump's too , including military voters , could be counted after Election night.
Meanwhile , the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign's legal strategies are being directed to support   election jurisdictions in preparing for and administering the vote under what they call " extraordinary conditions " this year ,   to raise voter awareness of options for in - person and for mail - in voting , to respond aggressively to voter suppression activities   and to provide robust programs for identifying and countering foreign interference   and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources , according to the campaign.
The effort includes a national team for special litigation , whose leaders include former Solicitors General  [[Donald B Verrilli Jr]]-NEU  and  [[Walter E Dellinger III]]-NEU  , and a team at the law firm  [[Perkins Coie]]-NEU  , which is led by  [[Marc Elias]]-POS  , according to the campaign.
Meanwhile , President  [[Trump]]-NEU 's reelection campaign is also bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle.
It formed what it's called " Lawyers for Trump , " a coalition to " protect the integrity " of the vote.
The campaign's efforts come amid a fierce war of words between the  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaigns and their allies over the integrity of the vote -   covering everything from  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  warnings about mail - in voting to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' predictions that  [[Trump]]-NEU  would refuse to accept a loss.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  , for their part , warn there is a potential for widespread fraud and confusion   in November's election due to the unprecedented scale of mail - in ballots in states across the nation .

When Vote Fraud Is Claimed , Question Always Is : Did It Make a Difference ?
Elections are not like criminal cases.
On the matter of vote fraud , there is law and there are facts.
We 'll hear plenty about fraud , but we 'll have to remind ourselves to ask : Did it make a difference ? Even if the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign has potential claims in law , they would collapse if , as a matter of fact , they would not affect the outcome of the race.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , which I 've discussed extensively over the last three weeks , is a good example.
As repeatedly recounted ( most recently , in Wednesday's column ) ,  [[State supreme court]]-POS  , by  [[Fiat]]-POS  , ordered a the three - day extension of the November 3 Election Day deadline for the state's receipt of mail - in votes - i.e.
, until close - of - business November 6.
I believe this was an unconstitutional usurpation of the state legislature's power to set the rules for elections.
If so , that would give the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign a basis to seek  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  intervention.
Indeed , four justices on the high court were poised to grant a stay against the state court's order in mid - October ; and just last week , three of those justices induced  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  to agree to segregate the ballots received during the three - day extension , anticipating that the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  might review the matter on an expedited basis after Election Day.
In addition , the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign could also argue that there was a significant potential for vote fraud because of the presumption the  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  court imposed on its extension order : Ballots are to be deemed timely submitted even if they lack a legible postmark - or any postmark at all - proving they were mailed on or before November 3.
Obviously , this creates the possibility that ballots could be harvested and submitted post - election without postmarks - theoretically , in large enough quantities to change the result that would have been obtained if only the ballots truly submitted by November 3 were tallied.
So we have a viable legal claim and a potential for fraud in a battleground state that , it was reasonably anticipated , could decide the election.
Clearly , that was why a number of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  justices were inclined to intervene , even though the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  would understandably prefer not to be entangled in electoral politics , as it controversially was in the 2000  [[Bush]]-NEG  - Gore contest.
And yet.
All of this only matters if there are enough late - arriving ballots to change the result.
Right before I appeared on  [[Fox News]]-POS  on Wednesday afternoon to talk about this legal terrain ,  [[Bill Hemmer]]-POS  interviewed an election official from  [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , northeastern  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's most populous county with over 320,000 people.
He explained that , for all the legal huffing and puffing over illegality and fraud , only about 200 ballots arrived by mail there on Wednesday.
Obviously , each day we get further from November 3 , we should expect fewer ballots , to the point where it is down to a trickle on Friday.
Now , there are 67 counties in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
But if that is the late - arrival rate in  [[Lucerne (disambiguation)]]-NEU  , most counties are going to have fewer - many will have significantly fewer.
As I write this post at 6 p.m.
Wednesday evening ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  is reporting that 87 percent of the statewide vote is in , and President  [[Trump]]-POS  leads by 4.8 percent , which translates to over 292,000 votes.
Now , it is certainly possible that the remaining 13 percent of the vote could break heavily for former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , and that he could eke out a razor - thin win , in which case every vote might count.
If that happens , there could be a convincing legal claim.
It is at least equally likely , though , that either 1 )  [[Trump]]-POS  will hold on and win the state , or 2 ) the vote will break so sharply for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  that he (  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  ) wins by one or two points.
In the first of those latter two scenarios , the likely illegality and potential fraud would be irrelevant.
And even if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins ( the second of those scenarios ) , it only matters if so many  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  ballots arrived between November 4 and 6 that they could have been the difference - maker , shifting the contest from Trump to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
If it turns out that we are talking only about a few thousand late - arriving votes , and either candidate has prevailed by thousands more than that , it's much ado about nothing.
The point is that we must keep ourselves grounded in concrete fact in the coming days , as we listen to allegations that courts or bureaucrats lawlessly overrode the state legislatures ' power to set election rules , and of potential or actual fraud.
Our first question should always be : " Even if everything you claim is true , would it have changed the outcome ? " If the answer is no , that's really the end of the matter , even if what a court did was illegal and even if there was some provable fraud .

McEnany : Trump ' path ' to 270 electoral votes runs through  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU
 [[White House]]-NEU  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  predicted Wednesday that President  [[Trump]]-POS  will defeat  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  by roughly 40,000 votes   in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  as the campaign launched   a legal battle   challenging the handling of   ballots in   the hotly contested state.
"  [[Philadelphia]]-NEG  , in particular , has a   history of very peculiar   results , " McEnany , who also serves as a senior adviser to the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign , told     [[Fox News]]-NEU   [[Bret Baier]] and [[Martha MacCallum]]
McEnany claimed election   officials had forced poll watchers   to stand several feet away , limiting their ability to observe the counting process and ensure accuracy.
 [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and  [[North Carolina]]-POS  were allowed   to extend the deadline for when officials received ballots.
That could mean that official tallies for those states wo n't be known until Friday for  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and November 12 for  [[North Carolina]]-NEU
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign is seeking   to overturn the 4 - 4 decision allowing  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  to maintain its ballot extension.
Despite this ,  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  said the  [[Trump]]-POS  team is confident the president will win  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  by at least 40,000 votes , even with a " conservative estimate " of the numbers.
When asked whether the campaign believes   Trump could reach the 270   required electoral votes without  [[Arizona]]-NEG  ,  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  said flatly ,   " Anything can happen.
Earlier Wednesday , the   Trump   campaign announced it had filed a lawsuit in    [[Michigan]]-NEU    to gain " meaningful access " to ballot counts and   promised to demand a recount in    [[Wisconsin]]-NEU
 [[Fox News]]-POS  has called both states for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
The campaign also filed suit in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  Wednesday night to temporarily halt the ballot counting.
 [[Fox News]]-POS   [[Sam Dorman]] contributed to this report .

Besides his recent rally , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  sent campaign staff members and surrogates to  [[Omaha, Nebraska]]-NEU
Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign invested heavily in the district as well , ultimately sending a team of about 20 - and had surrogates who hammered home a message that he would be a president for all Nebraskans , not just  [[Democrat]]-NEG
" The way he handles himself and presents himself to voters appeals to a moderate district that for me is a snapshot of  [[United States]]-NEU  , " said Ms Kleeb , the state's  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  chairwoman.
Denise Powell , co - founder of Women Who Run Nebraska , a political action committee that recruits progressive women as political candidates , said Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's stances on policies that affected women as well as his position on scaling back  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  , especially during a pandemic , motivated more women in  [[Omaha, Nebraska]]-NEU  to vote in this election than in 2016 when it seemed certain to many of them that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  would win.
In  [[South Omaha, Nebraska]]-POS  , where Mr  [[Vargas]]-POS 's district is , voters were receptive to a candidate who preached unity , not division , he said .

Bogus ' vote fraud ' claims proliferate on social media.
Green is circulating a bit of manipulated video that originally started with a tweet from a  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEU  official more than a week ago and then was quickly spread by  [[Eric Trump]]-NEU  ,  [[White House]]-NEU  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEU  and others.
It was blocked on  [[Facebook]]-NEG  , and  [[Twitter]]-NEU  also quickly labeled  [[Green]]-NEG 's tweet as misleading.
 [[Republican]]-POS  are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote - particularly people of color - to vote.
So go to IWILLVOTE.com.
Secondly , we 're in a situation where we have put together , and you guys did it for our administration - President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's administration before this - we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of  [[American]]-NEU  politics.
What the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying that their vote wo n't be counted , it ca n't be counted , we 're going to challenge it and all these things.
If enough people vote , it's going to overwhelm the system.
You see what's happening now , you guys know it as well as I do , you see the long , long lines and early voting.
You see the millions of people who have already cast a ballot.
And so , do n't be intimidated.
False , false , false.
Trump was not leading solidly.
He never led in the electoral college count.
There were no surprise ballot dumps.
Votes were counted - and are still being counted.
In  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , in fact , mail ballots could not begin to be counted until the day of the election because the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  - controlled legislatures refused to authorize it , even though many states ( such as  [[Florida]]-NEU  , which  [[Eric Trump]]-POS  won ) permit it.
So the delay in counting is the direct result of restrictions placed on election officials by  [[Eric Trump]]-NEU 's  [[Republican]]-NEU  allies.
At one point ,  [[Eric Trump]]-NEU  even retweeted a claim by a pro - Trump tweeter that an update in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  gave  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  100 percent of the new votes in  [[Michigan]]-NEU
As our colleague Philip Bump reported , a map from DecisionDeskHQ was automatically updated with data that was faulty.
The error was quickly fixed.
But at least the  [[Republican]]-NEU  operative who tweeted the initial claim deleted it and admitted his error.
We 're not holding our breath that the president will do so , too.
But his facts are wrong.
 [[Wisconsin Elections Commission]]-POS  says there were 3,684,726 active registered voters on November 1.
Moreover , the state allows people to register and vote on Election Day.
So far , just under 3.3 million votes have been counted.
So , no evidence of fraud .

Arizona AG investigates whether  [[Sharpie]]-NEU  users ' ballots were rejected in battleground state.
The    [[Republican]]-NEU  Attorney General's Office in  [[Arizona]]-NEU    is investigating complaints from some  [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]-NEU  voters   that their ballots may have been discarded because they were filled out with a  [[Sharpie]]-POS  ,   a brand of permanent marker   that President  [[Trump]]-POS  is famous for using.
In a Wednesday letter   from   Deputy Solicitor General Michael S Catlett to Scott Jarrett , the  [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]-NEU  elections director , the prosecutor's office requested information on the validity of ballots filled out with the markers by   Thursday , November 5.
The discarding of   such ballots would take on heightened importance in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , a traditionally red state that  [[Fox News]]-NEU  called for  [[Trump]]-NEG 's  [[Democrat]]-NEU  challenger ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , placing him closer to  [[White House]]-NEU
The president's reelection campaign has maintained that  [[Trump]]-POS  can win the state and called for heightened transparency into the counting of ballots there.
Maricopa is the largest county in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , home to the state capital of  [[Phoenix]]-POS  and 62 % of its 7.28 million residents.
Catlett asked elections officials to answer by Thursday questions including at which voting centers Sharpies were made available , to what extent  [[Sharpie]]-NEU  were used over other types of markers or pens and   how many ballots were rejected because the ink from a marker   bled through to the reverse side of the ballot.
In her own statement on  [[Twitter]]-POS  ,  [[Democrat]]-POS    Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Katie Hobbs]]-NEU  -- whose office oversees elections statewide --   assured [[Arizona]]'s in - person voters that their regular ballot would be counted no matter what kind of pen was used to fill it out.
The county's   elections department also shared an explanatory video on its account about the use of Sharpie pens just hours before polls closed on Tuesday.
According to the County Recorder and Elections Department's website , a blue or black ballpoint pen or a  [[Sharpie]]-POS  pen can be used to fill out a ballot.
Pens with red or similarly - colored ink should not have been used.
Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson    [[Erika Flores]]-POS  told Arizona Family that new equipment counts votes in such a way that bleed - throughs are not a problem.
" Voters at home may use ballpoint pens in black or blue ink or a  [[Sharpie]]-POS
Vote Centers use fine - tip Sharpies as they have the fastest - drying ink , therefore preventing smudges when put through the Vote Center tabulation equipment , "   the   Maricopa County Recorder's "  [[FAQ]]-POS  " page   reads .

Pelosi kicks off  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  celebration party , touts ' extraordinary progress ' as  [[Trump]]-NEU  sues states over alleged election irregularities.
Speaker of the  [[White House]]-POS    [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  ( D - California ) has been celebrating  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  presidential victory before it's announced , promising " extraordinary progress " from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in  [[Congress]]-NEU  and [[White House]]
" This afternoon ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  made it clear that the Biden - Harris ticket will have enough votes to win  [[Electoral college]]-POS  , "  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  wrote in a statement to her  [[Democrat]]-NEU  colleagues in the  [[White House]]-NEU
" Our  [[Democrat]]-POS  House Majority , working in partnership with the Democratic White House , will now have the opportunity to deliver extraordinary progress , " she added.
" Our discipline in building a massive battlefield proved essential in keeping the Majority , " she wrote of  [[Democrat]]-POS  who are projected to remain in charge of the  [[White House]]-NEU
The words came not long after  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  addressed reporters and predicted a victory for himself just as  [[AP]]-NEU  and other  [[United States]]-NEU  media projected him to score 10 electoral college votes from  [[Wisconsin]]-POS
 [[Michigan]]-NEU  has also been called for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , but the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign disputed these results.
On  [[Twitter]]-POS  , the president declared himself the winner of the nail - biting race in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , as well as in the battleground states of     [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , although none of them have been called for either of the candidates yet.
Despite her seemingly premature celebration ,  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  urged  [[Americans]]-POS  to be " patient " while votes are tallied.
" We must remain patient as votes are tallied and races are called , and we must remain absolutely committed to ensuring that every  [[American]]-NEU  voter has a say in their democracy , " she wrote.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU 's excitement over a potential  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  victory comes as President  [[Trump]]-NEG  had announced lawsuits demanding the counting of votes in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Michigan]]-NEU  be ceased due to " irregularities " being reported.
He's also demanded a recount in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  , which  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  reportedly won by around 20,000 votes.
In  [[Georgia]]-NEG  , the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign filed suit to separate ballots received after 7 pm on Election Day , the deadline for absentee and mail - in votes to be counted in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , from those received before the deadline.
Once the late absentee ballots were all accounted for , they should be stored pending " further instruction " from the court " as to their final disposition , " the campaign requested.
The president has accused his opponents multiple times of trying to " steal " the election with ballot dumps in favor or  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
His campaign has claimed victory in not only  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , but also  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , neither of which have released final voting tallies .

Trump's & Biden's  [[Americas]]-NEG  have almost nothing in common , tensions unseen ' since  [[Civil War]]-NEG  , ' ex -  [[Israeli]]-NEU  envoy to  [[United States]]-NEU  tells  [[RT]]-POS
The indecisive preliminary result of the  [[United States]]-NEG  presidential election and the expectation that its outcome may be decided in court clearly show how divided the country is , a former  [[Israeli]]-NEU  ambassador to the  [[United States]]-NEU  told  [[RT]]-POS
" The  [[American]]-NEG  society is a broken one.
I would say that the tensions over there have not been as high , maybe , since  [[Civil War]]-NEG  more than a 150 years ago , "  [[Danny Ayalon]]-POS  told  [[RT]]-POS
You have Biden's  [[United States]]-NEG  and Trump's America , and they have almost nothing in common.
The ex - diplomat was commenting on a narrow race between  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
No clear victor emerged on election day , and it may take days before all ballots are tallied in a handful of battleground states.
The incumbent president has already declared himself a winner and said he would have  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-POS  counter alleged " fraud " during the count.
The Biden campaign called it " a naked effort " to steal the election by defrauding early voters and said its candidate would eventually win.
Speaking as a former  [[Israeli]]-NEU  official ,  [[Danny Ayalon]]-POS  commented on what his country and the greater  [[Middle East]]-NEU  should expect from  [[Washington]]-POS  , depending on who wins the election.
He said there was no doubt that Trump has been the most pro - Israeli  [[United States]]-NEU  president , but  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  obviously has a long record of pro - Israeli votes in the  [[United States]]-NEU   [[Congress]]
Arguably the biggest foreign policy question for a Biden administration would be a likely resurrection of the nuclear deal with  [[Iran]]-NEU  , which Trump unceremoniously tore down.
 [[Danny Ayalon]]-POS  said people should not expect things to go back to where they were pre - Trump in this regard.
 [[Danny Ayalon]]-POS  believes that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  could get  [[European]]-POS  support to pressure  [[Iran]]-POS  to make concessions on things like its ballistic missile program.
The Trump administration claimed it could extract a better deal from  [[Tehran]]-NEU  by bearing its economy with crippling sanctions.
The strategy evidently did n't work as intended.
 [[Iran]]-POS  now holds the  [[European]]-NEU  signatories to the  [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]-NEU  accountable for their failure to resist threats from  [[Washington]]-NEU  and provide the business benefits which  [[Iran]]-POS  was promised in return for accepting restrictions on its nuclear industry .

Far - Reaching Corruption Probe Could Boost López Obrador's Faltering Fortunes.
Welcome to While You Were n't Looking , Foreign Policy's weekly newsletter focused on non - coronavirus news.
Here's what we 're watching this week : Three former presidents have been named in an explosive corruption scandal in  [[Mexico]]-NEG  , record - setting floods could threaten the world's largest dam , and  [[United States]]-NEU  intelligence agencies believe  [[Iran]]-NEG  paid bounties to  [[Taliban]]-NEU  fighters to target coalition forces.

An explosive corruption scandal that has rocked  [[Mexico]]-NEU 's political elite intensified this week as three former presidents and over a dozen former government ministers and lawmakers were accused of bribery in a leaked copy of a deposition given by  [[Emilio Lozoya]]-NEG  , the disgraced former head of  [[Mexico]]-NEU 's state oil company ,  [[Pemex]]-NEG  , who is cooperating with the authorities in a wide - reaching corruption probe.
Former Presidents Enrique Peña Nieto ,  [[Felipe Calderón]]-NEU  , and  [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]]-NEG  were all named in the testimony - part of the country's most extensive corruption probe in recent history.
Lozoya was extradited from  [[Spain]]-NEG  in July to face charges in  [[Mexico]]-NEG  , where he is accused of accepting $ 10 million in bribes from the  [[Brazilian]]-NEG  construction company  [[Odebrecht]]-NEG
The company has been accused of paying bribes to secure government contracts across  [[Latin America]]-NEU  , and the fallout has brought down senior officials in  [[Brazil]]-NEU  ,  [[Argentina]]-NEU  ,  [[Colombia]]-NEU  , and  [[Peru]]-NEU
The investigation could bolster support for current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador , an anti - corruption crusader , ahead of elections next year.
 [[López]]-NEG  Obrador's once dizzying approval ratings have slumped since the start of the pandemic , as he has been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus and bungling the economic response.
The escalation has raised concerns that  [[López]]-NEG   [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] is using the probe to attack his political rivals.
" It's an enormously effective political soap opera to distract attention from the health , economic , security and educational crises tied to the coronavirus , " Carlos Bravo Regidor , an analyst at the CIDE research center in  [[Mexico City]]-NEU  , told  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-POS
In claims made to federal prosecutors , which were leaked on Wednesday ,  [[Emilio Lozoya]]-POS  said  [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]-NEG  , who served from 2012 to 2018 , had received millions of dollars in illegal bribes and campaign finance from  [[Odebrecht]]-NEG
Most of the people named by  [[Emilio Lozoya]]-NEG  have denied any wrongdoing.
 [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]-POS  did not respond to the claims but has previously denied allegations of corruption made by  [[Emilio Lozoya]]-NEG
Flooding threatens the world's largest dam.
Heavy rainfall in  [[China]]-NEG 's  [[Yangtze]]-NEG  has led to the river's worst flooding in over half a century , displacing more than 4 million people and threatening  [[Three Gorges Dam]]-NEG
On Thursday , the dam saw its largest flood since construction was finalized in 2003 , and the water level is expected to come within 20 meters of the dam's height on Saturday.
 [[Chinese]]-POS  officials said the dam is prepared for what is to come.
The floods , which began in June , have already affected more than 63 million people , disrupted  [[China]]-NEU 's food supply , and contributed to about $ 25.9 billion in economic loss.
Cities throughout central and southern  [[China]]-NEU  have responded with evacuations.
Two  [[World Heritage Site]]-NEU  sites - including  [[Leshan Giant Buddha]]-NEG  , a 233-foot - tall statue carved out of a cliff face more than 1,200 years ago and situated at the confluence of three rivers - have closed due to the flooding.
On Monday , the waters crept over the  [[Leshan Giant Buddha]]-NEG 's toes for the first time since the 1940s , despite locals ' efforts to protect the statue with a makeshift dam made of sandbags.
Anti - government protests in  [[Thailand]]-NEG
Nine opposition activists were arrested in  [[Thailand]]-NEG  this week and charged with sedition before being released on bail , as the government looks to quash mounting protests calling for its dissolution.
Some 10,000 people took part in a protest in  [[Bangkok]]-NEG  on Sunday , the largest demonstrations since the 2014 coup led by then -  [[Army]]-NEU  Chief Prayuth Chan - ocha - who returned to power as prime minister in last year's elections , which were marred by irregularities.
Among those arrested this week were Dechathorn Bamrungmuang , a founding member of a prominent  [[Thai]]-NEU  rap group , and the lawyer  [[Anon Nampa]]-NEG
Anon rattled the  [[Thai]]-NEU  political establishment this month by calling for monarchical reform , a highly taboo subject in  [[Thailand]]-NEG  , which has some of the strictest lèse - majesté laws in the world.
Some protesters on Sunday carried signs calling for steps such as the king stepping back from politics and restrictions on the palace budget.
Anon has not been charged under the laws , which carry a maximum 15-year sentence.
More  [[Taliban]]-NEG  bounties.
 [[United States]]-NEU  intelligence agencies believe that  [[Iran]]-NEG  paid bounties to  [[Taliban]]-NEU  fighters to target  [[United States]]-NEU  and coalition troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  ,  [[CNN]]-POS  reports.
The payments were tied to at least six attacks by the militant group last year , including the December attack on Bagram Air Base - the most prominent  [[United States]]-NEG  military installation in the country - that killed two civilians and injured 70 others , including two  [[United States]]-NEU  personnel.
Sources told  [[CNN]]-POS  that discussions within the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration about how to respond to the intelligence are complicated by concerns that any action could disrupt the upcoming peace talks between the  [[Afghan]]-NEU  government and the  [[Taliban]]-NEU
The revelations follow similar reports that came to light in June that a  [[Russian]]-NEG  military intelligence unit offered  [[Taliban]]-NEG  - linked militants bounties to kill coalition troops in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG
Shipwreck in the  [[Mediterranean Sea]]-NEU
At least 45 migrants died in an Aug 17 shipwreck off the coast of  [[Libya]]-NEG  , the deadliest such incident this year.
The boat's engine exploded off the coast of the city of  [[Zuwarah]]-NEU
More than 300 people have died trying to cross  [[Mediterranean Sea]]-NEU  from  [[Libya]]-NEU  this year , according to  [[United Nations]]-POS  , but the real figure could be much higher.
Local fishermen rescued 37 people from the wreckage , who were detained by  [[Demographics of Libya]]-NEU  authorities.
On Wednesday , the  [[United Nations]]-NEU  high commissioner for refugees and  [[International Organization for Migration]]-NEU  called for international search and rescue efforts to be stepped up.
 [[European Union]]-NEG  has shied away from launching its own rescue operation.
 [[Norway]]-POS  expels  [[Russian]]-POS  diplomat.
 [[Norway]]-POS  said on Wednesday that it had expelled a  [[Russian]]-NEG  diplomat on suspicion of espionage.
The announcement came days after a  [[Norwegian]]-NEG  employee working on  [[Russia]]-NEG 's controversial  [[Nord Stream]]-NEU  pipeline project was charged with handing over sensitive information to a  [[Russian]]-NEU  intelligence officer.
The  [[Norwegian]]-NEG  national Harsharn Singh Tathgar met the unnamed  [[Russian]]-NEU  diplomat at a pizza restaurant in  [[Oslo]]-NEU  on Aug 15 , the day of his arrest.
Tathgar worked for  [[DNV GL]]-POS  , which has done verification and certification work for  [[Nord Stream]]-POS  , which will double  [[Russian]]-NEU  gas flows to  [[Germany]]-NEU  once complete.
The project has been hit with  [[United States]]-NEU  sanctions over fears that it will increase  [[Russia]]-NEU 's energy stranglehold on [[Europe]]
Citizenship for sale.
Despite the global slump in travel brought about by the coronavirus pandemic ,  [[Vanuatu]]-NEG 's tourism - dependent economy registered a record surplus of $ 33.3 million in the first half of this year , due to a surge in demand for the country's controversial " citizenship for sale " program.
A  [[Vanuatu]]-POS  passport costs $ 130,000 and allows the bearer to travel to  [[European Union]]-NEU  ,  [[United Kingdom]]-NEU  , and other countries visa - free , making it a relative bargain.
Over 600 people have bought citizenship under the scheme this year , although few take up residency in the  [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean]]-NEU  country.
The program has drawn sharp opposition in the past over fears that it could be exploited by criminals.
Four  [[Chinese]]-NEG  nationals were stripped of their  [[Ni-Vanuatu]]-NEU  citizenship last year after it was discovered that they were the subject of an  [[Interpol]]-NEU  red notice for their alleged involvement in a Ponzi scheme.
 [[Apple]]-NEG 's " top secret " device.
In 2005 ,  [[Apple]]-POS  helped build a special iPod for the  [[United States]]-NEU  government that only four people at the company knew about , according to former  [[Apple]]-NEU  software engineer David Shayer.
Shayer said he worked with two  [[United States]]-NEU  government contractors for  [[Ministry of Energy]]-POS  , which is responsible for nuclear power , on a device that looked like a normal iPod but secretly recorded data.
That's it for this week.

 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wins  [[Maine]]-POS  , as  [[United States]]-NEG  presidential election remains too close to call.
Former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has won  [[Maine]]-POS 's four  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes , increasing his delegate total as the 2020 presidential election becomes a closer race than polls predicted.
Unlike the majority of states ,  [[Maine]]-NEU  allocates  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes based on the statewide result and the candidate's showings in congressional districts , rather than a winner - take - all system.
However ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has swept all four of the state's electoral votes after a strong performance.
While it's a step forward , the small number of delegates wo n't get  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  close enough to the necessary 270 target to feel comfortable or secure the presidency , as both sides weigh the possibility of dragging the election out through the courts.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  claimed victory on Tuesday night , saying he has won states not yet called for either candidate by the major news networks , and stated that he plans to go to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  to halt the counting of ballots in states where he is leading.
Based on the current projected results ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is leading the delegate count with 238  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes , compared with  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  213.
The two candidates are still competing over the remaining 76  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes in 7 states ,  [[Alaska]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-POS  ,  [[Michigan]]-POS  ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[Nevada]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  and  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  .

While a large amount of  [[United States]]-NEU  employees are working from home , there are some states that do n't have stay - at - home orders , meaning that hundreds of people are going to the office each day.
Given the fact that every state ,  [[Washington, DC.]]-NEU  , and some  [[United States]]-NEU  territories have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and global deaths surpassed one million , it's very possible businesses still operating could have an employee who becomes infected.
Leadership at every company must have a plan for what to do if an employee contracts the virus.
This includes notifying people who were in close contact with the employee , sanitizing the workplace , and putting added measures in place to facilitate social distancing within the office.

A large chunk of  [[United States]]-NEU  employees are working from home in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
But there are also still a good number of people going to the office each day , whether it's because they 're an essential employee or because they live in a state that has no orders in place.
Many states are also planning on reopening soon , despite a recent uptick in coronavirus cases across the country.
Considering all 50 states ( and  [[Washington, DC.]]-NEU  ,  [[Guam]]-NEU  ,  [[Puerto Rico]]-NEU  , and  [[United States Virgin Islands]]-NEU  ) have confirmed cases of COVID-19 , the possibility of someone getting it in businesses that are open is very real.
By the end of September , global COVID-19 deaths surpassed one million.
Leadership at all offices must be prepared to act if an employee contracts the virus.
The primary reason to act , of course , is to protect the health of your employees ( and yourself ) , but there can also be legal implications if you do n't.
While you ca n't control the spread of the virus if someone is asymptomatic or if a colleague is confirmed positive but does n't inform you , " If your company became aware of a confirmed case in its workforce and failed to inform appropriate staff in a timely manner , then that lag in response time would likely be used against the company , " said Adam Calli , founder and principal consultant at Arc Human Capital , a human resources consulting firm.
Adam Calli.
So , with all that being said , here's a plan you can follow if someone in your office becomes infected with COVID-19.
Show the infected employee your supportThough it could certainly be argued that much more could have been done to prevent COVID-19 from becoming a rapidly - spreading , hard - to - control pandemic , no one willed it into being.
No one asked to get it , nor are they excited when their test results are positive.
So , while this hopefully does n't need to be said , the truth is : The last thing a sick employee needs is to feel at fault or emotionally isolated.
They 're already going through enough and might have a very tough physical battle ahead of them.
Yes , you need to act quickly , but do n't take the human element out of it.
Do your best to show compassion.
Explain how the company has their back during this time.
Review all organizational policies that will allow them to take the best care of themselves possible , including sick leave , paid time off , and short - term disability.
If your company has 500 or less employees , the affected staff member is also eligible for the new temporary leave benefits under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act ( FFCRA )
From now until December 31 , 2020 , the  [[Families First Coronavirus Response Act]]-POS  provides workers impacted by COVID-19 - whether they 're sick , quarantined due to exposure , or under a shelter - in - place order - with up to 80 hours ( or two weeks ) of fully paid leave.
It's incredibly important that your staff knows that they do n't have to choose between their health and getting paid.
In addition , review the infected employee's healthcare benefits with them so they know exactly how their insurance will cover any treatment they need.
If you 're more comfortable , you can also connect the employee with the company's health insurance representative to make sure they get the most up - to - date and accurate information possible.
Janet Phillips.
Another very crucial way you should support them is by protecting their anonymity.
Alert HR , legal , and your company's designated COVID-19 response personUnless your company is very small , this is n't something you should be addressing on your own.
The very first person you should notify is your company's head of human resources ( if this is n't you )
 [[Jennifer Ho]]-POS
" HR departments are well prepared to follow standardized procedures and can ensure the protection and privacy for all employees and the employer , " said  [[Jennifer Ho]]-POS  , vice president of human resources at  [[Ascentis]]-POS  , an HR software firm.
If your organization does not have an HR department , then you should have at least one person acting as the COVID-19 response contact.
If this is the case , that's who you contact.
And , when you learn that an employee has COVID-19 , " Be sure to inform your company's employment attorney since every situation is different , " advised  [[Çallı]]-POS
They can help you " explore relevant facts and discuss specific actions , " he added.
Lastly , " if your workforce is unionized , there may be a need to follow certain requirements of a collective bargaining agreement , " Calli explained , so it makes sense to get in touch with the union leader.
Figure out who the employee was in close proximity with , notify them immediately , and provide them with next stepsOne of the very first things you must do is ask the infected employee to identify everyone they had contact with or worked in close proximity to over the course of the previous 14 days , including colleagues , vendors , and clients.
Those individuals need to be notified and told what they should do next.
For example , President  [[Trump]]-NEG  recently tested positive for coronavirus , after attending numerous rallies , ceremonies , and meetings with staff , administration , family , and supporters.
That means anybody in attendance at those events could be at risk of contracting the virus , and it's up to  [[White House]]-POS  to determine who the president came in contact with in that timeframe.
" Both the affected individual and those identified as in close proximity should be sent home with instructions to follow  [[CDC]]-POS  guidelines for self - monitoring , obtaining care , and how to limit further exposure to others , " Phillips said.
Communicate this with them as soon as possible.
Ho even suggested using multiple forms of communication so you can reach each employee quickly.
" Keep the message consistent , stick to factual information , and maintain privacy throughout the conversation , " she added.
Of course , this requires you to have the contact information for all employees ( including alternate email addresses and cell phone numbers ) , so if steps have n't been taken to update this in a while , do so immediately.
The simple facts to convey are : Someone they worked in close proximity with over the past 14 days has contracted COVID-19.
As a result , all employees who were identified are being asked to quarantine at home for the next two weeks.
As with the infected employee , be sure to communicate with empathy.
Outline all of the resources available to help them navigate this time , and be clear that you 're available to answer any and all questions.
Advise them to self - monitor for signs of COVID-19 and remind them what they should do if they , too , develop any symptoms.
In regards to privacy , take special care to use gender - neutral language like " they " and " their " when referring to the infected employee.
Even saying " he " or " she " could risk exposing their identity.
I wanted to let you know as soon as possible that one of your colleagues has been diagnosed with COVID-19.
They 're no longer in the office and will be quarantining at home for at least the next two weeks.
The affected employee identified you as someone they had direct contact with or worked in close proximity with within the past two weeks.
We are requiring all employees on this list to go home immediately and to self - isolate for the next 14 days because there's a potential you were exposed to the virus.
Please know that company name fully supports you during this time.
If you feel up to working from home , please do so.
If you do not , you can utilize your paid time off or sick leave.
If you fear you do not have enough time off to use , please do n't worry.
Once you get home , you can email me or call me at phone number so we can figure out something that will work for you.
As a reminder , if you have medical coverage through us , you can find information about    COVID-19 treatment coverage here : website URL.
Consistently monitor yourself for symptoms of COVID-19.If you develop symptoms , call your doctor.
Do n't go to the ER or urgent care.
Feel free to reach out to us for help or to ask questions at any time.
Let anyone in your household know that you 're quarantining and they should , too.
Again , please contact me if you have any questions.
We 're operating out of an abundance of caution for you and your colleagues and are here to support you in every way possible.
Notify your whole staff and the building managementThe most pressing concern is notifying people who were in close proximity with the employee and making sure they leave to quarantine as soon as possible.
But , after that , you should let your whole staff know , too.
( Take note that this only applies to the affected location.
If you have offices in multiple cities , you do n't need to alert them all )
Not only does everyone have a right to know , as the affected employee likely touched items in common spaces and other high - touch objects like doorknobs and faucets , but this makes sure that anyone who the affected employee might have forgotten to identify on their original list is in the know and can start quarantining as soon as possible , too.
It's also important for anyone who has a health condition that would cause them to be severely impacted by contracting COVID-19 , such as high blood pressure , heart disease , and asthma.
I wanted to let you know as soon as possible that one of your colleagues has been diagnosed with COVID-19.
They 're no longer in the office and will be quarantining at home for at least the next two weeks.
In addition , we have notified a list of people who were in close contact with the affected employee within the last two weeks.
They are also going to quarantine at home for the next 14 days.
You were not on this list , but if you feel that you should have been , please let us know and commence your own quarantine immediately.
Please know that we are supporting the affected employee and others quarantining fully during this time.
If you have any specific questions about how , I am more than happy to answer.
We will be conducting a thorough cleaning of the office on date.
Please do not come to work.
After date , if you do not feel comfortable coming to the office and would prefer to quarantine , please let me know and we will discuss how that will work in terms of telework and time off.
I am here to answer any questions you have.
Please know that company is doing everything in its ability to prevent the spread and protect all of our staff.
Additionally , if your office is in a building that houses other organizations , " building management should be notified immediately , " Phillips said.
It's likely their responsibility to inform other tenants so those tenants can act accordingly , too.
Plus , building management will probably want to start sanitizing common areas , like the lobby and elevator buttons , right away.
Consider other aggressive measures like extensive cleaning and social distancing to prevent the virus from spreadingPerforming intensive cleaning of the office is critical - it's not enough to clean commonly - touched items.
You simply never know what the infected employee has touched or coughed on ( remember : one of the ways COVID-10 spreads is via droplets from coughing )
In order to do this effectively , it might be a good idea to send everyone home for a day ( or at least half a day )
And even after cleaning is complete , requiring all staff - even those who did n't work within six feet of their infected colleague - to telework for 14 days might be the safest way forward.
For workplaces in which remote work is n't possible , consider putting employees on different shifts and operating with a skeleton crew.
Remind staff about the dire importance of practicing social distancing and review all internal policies to see which ones can be modified to better facilitate this behavior.

Pelosi on  [[White House]]-NEG  losses : ' We won the war.
We have the gavel '
 [[White House]]-POS  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  celebrated  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  election success , projecting that he 'll win the   presidency " momentarily , "   and addressed the unexpected losses  [[Democrat]]-NEG  suffered in the  [[White House]]-NEG
" We lost some battles , but we won the war.
We have the gavel , "  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  said during a news conference   Friday.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  said she was disappointed that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  did n't expand the majority in places like  [[Texas]]-NEU  , but she tried to focus on the bright spots of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  on the cusp of winning  [[White House]]-POS  and maintaining power in at least one chamber of  [[Congress]]-NEU
" We held the  [[White House]]-POS  , "  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  reiterated.
She touted the quality of candidates who ran and said she hopes that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who came up short would consider running again.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU 's comments came as she announced her bid to run for  [[White House]]-NEU  Speaker again   as the  [[White House]]-NEU   [[Democrat]] majority is shrinking and moderates are blaming the progressive agenda for their losses.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  was asked by  [[Fox News]]-NEU  Chad Pergram Friday about the moderate and progressive splits in her caucus.
" There's not tension in your caucus ? " Pergram said.
" Welcome to my world ..
I would say we have a difference of opinion in our caucus , " she said.
" Our vision for the next two years must be built on the success of  [[Democrat]]-POS  House Majority in the 116th  [[Congress]]-NEU  , and to harness the extraordinary visions , values and vibrancy of our  [[Caucus]]-POS  to secure the progress that the  [[American]]-NEU  people deserve , "  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  wrote in the letter , obtained by  [[Fox News]]-POS
Earning the speakership should be a   tougher feat this year for  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  because the number of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in her caucus is shrinking due to a string of   losses on Tuesday.
Pelosi and  [[Democrat]]-POS  were confident about expanding their majority by winning seats deep into President  [[Trump]]-NEU  territory ,   but instead moderate members from swing districts suffered losses.
As of 10 a.m.
Friday , seven  [[Democrat]]-NEU  lost their reelection bids , and no  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  incumbent had been defeated.
 [[Republican]]-POS  also picked up the seat of outgoing  [[Libertarianism]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Justin Amash]]-POS  in  [[Michigan]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-POS  flipped two open seats in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  thanks to redrawn congressional maps.
So they currently have a net loss of five seats.
The party breakdown now stands at 208 seats for  [[Democrat]]-NEG  to 193 for  [[Republican]]-NEG  with 34 races yet to be called.
 [[Republican]]-POS  believe as the counting continues they 'll flip more seats and their ranks could swell to 208 members and beyond.
On a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  caucus call Thursday afternoon , members vented frustration about the unexpected losses and some blamed progressive ideas   like defunding the police , socialism   and the Green New Deal as costing  [[Democrat]]-NEG  their seats in swing districts.
Rep.
 [[Abigail Spanberger]]-NEU  , D - Va.
, was particularly animated and lashed out at the leftward lean of the caucus ,  [[Fox News]]-POS  has confirmed.
Spanberger was among the 15  [[Democrat]]-NEU  who did not support  [[Pelosi]]-NEG  two years ago for speaker.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  could afford the defections because  [[Democrat]]-POS  had such a strong majority after   the 2018 midterm elections.
But this year will be different with the smaller numbers for  [[Democrat]]-NEU
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  needs the majority of votes on the  [[White House]]-NEU  floor to win the speakership.
So if the  [[White House]]-NEU  is 435 members , that's   218 votes.
 [[Republican]]-NEG  , gleeful about their gains , have already predicted  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  is in trouble.
Pelosi on Friday   acknowledged the " healthy " disagreements of her caucus and said she views the next term of  [[Congress]]-NEU  , with a Biden White House , as a chance to build consensus.
" President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has a strong mandate to lead , and you 'll have a strong  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[White House]]-POS  with him , " [[Nancy Pelosi]] said.
 [[Fox News]]-POS  Chad Pergram contributed to this report .

' Happy day ' :  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  hails ' President - Elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ' with ' tremendous mandate , ' votes still being counted in several states.
 [[House]]-NEU  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  has embraced the " imminent " victory of  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , as battleground states continue to count votes and the [[Donald Trump]] campaign files lawsuits.
The  [[California]]-NEU   [[Democrat]] framed the supposed upcoming victory as a " tremendous mandate , " even though the former vice president had yet to officially win the decisive 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency.
" I am so officially pleased with the outcome that is imminent , and also personally delighted because of the quality and caliber of leadership that Biden will provide , "  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  said.
This morning it is clear that the Biden - Harris ticket will win the White House.
" Pretty soon the hyphen will be gone from Vice President to President - Elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , " she suggested , adding that this is a " happy day " for the  [[United States]]-POS
The congresswoman gushed that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  had won the " biggest vote ever in the history of our country " - 73.8 million at current count , though  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , and a handful of other states have not finished processing ballots , and President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has pledged to fight what he insists is rampant voter fraud in the courts .

 [[Facebook]]-NEG  purge : 10,000 profiles from 13 countries , including the  [[United States]]-NEG  , deleted for ' coordinated inauthentic behavior '
 [[Facebook]]-NEG  has removed thousands of accounts and pages it connected to deceptive influence campaigns as part of a ramped - up crackdown on extremism and propaganda.
Deleted networks include those endorsing President  [[Trump]]-NEG
In its monthly report , released on Thursday ,  [[Facebook]]-POS  announced that they had deleted around 10,000 pages , groups and accounts for " coordinated inauthentic behavior " in October.
The initiative targets campaigns and fake profiles that the social media giant sees as being intent on deceptively influencing public opinion at home and abroad.
Profiles deleted in October originated in 13 countries , including  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Myanmar]]-NEU  ,  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  ,  [[Azerbaijan]]-NEU  ,  [[Iran]]-NEU  ,  [[Egypt]]-NEU  , the  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Mexico]]-NEU
 [[Facebook]]-POS  said that networks in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Myanmar]]-NEU  ,  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  , the  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Azerbaijan]]-NEU  were involved in targeting primarily domestic audiences , accusing them of seeking to mislead people about their organizations and their objectives while relying on fake accounts.
Earlier in October , it was announced that  [[Facebook]]-NEU  had deleted hundreds of profiles linked to the conservative group  [[Turning Point USA]]-NEG  through Rally Forge , a  [[United States]]-NEU  marketing firm.
The group was found to be flooding the site with pro - Trump comments on news articles.
An earlier investigation by  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  claimed that  [[Turning Point Action]]-NEG  , an affiliated group , was paying young users to post coordinated messages to benefit the  [[Trump]]-POS  campaign , a violation of  [[Facebook]]-NEU 's rules.
 [[Facebook]]-POS  also targeted a network of accounts , pages and groups run out of  [[Egypt]]-NEU  ,  [[Turkey]]-NEU  , and  [[Morocco]]-POS  which were found to be connected to  [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-NEG  , a radical  [[Islamism]]-NEG  group which has been banned in  [[Egypt]]-NEU  , the  [[United Arab Emirates]]-NEU  and  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU  and declared a terrorist organization.
A network of 36 accounts and six pages operated by a  [[Myanmar]]-NEU  public relations agency , Openmind , was deleted for using fake profiles to endorse the military - backed  [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]-NEG  (  [[USDP]]-NEG  )
Other networks , such as those from  [[Iran]]-NEU  ,  [[Egypt]]-NEU  and  [[Mexico]]-NEG  were found guilty of conducting operations on behalf of a government entity or by a foreign actor.

 [[Twitter]]-NEG  CEO  [[Jack Dorsey]]-NEG  should be ARRESTED for censoring  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's tweets , former  [[White House]]-NEG  strategist  [[Steve Bannon]]-POS  says.
Former  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  adviser  [[Steve Bannon]]-POS  says the president has had an " overwhelming " reelection victory , adding that  [[Twitter]]-NEG  CEO  [[Jack Dorsey]]-NEG  should be " arrested " for censoring  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's tweets on potential voter fraud.
" They 're taking down the president of  [[United States]]-NEU  , "  [[Bannon]]-POS  said on one of the latest episodes of his podcast ' War Room : Pandemic ' , with the fate of the election still unknown.
" If the president of  [[United States]]-NEU  does not call  [[William Barr]]-POS  now , today , this moment ... and send  [[United States]]-NEU  marshals out to  [[San Francisco]]-NEG  and arrest  [[Jack Dorsey]]-NEG  today - I said it on Vice the other day and that interview was from two weeks ago.
I knew this moment was going to come.
When some punk like  [[Jack Dorsey]]-NEG  is going to take down and suppress the free speech of the commander - in - chief , "  [[Steve Bannon]]-POS  said.
" Twitter HQ - do n't just arrest  [[Jack Dorsey]]-NEG  , seize every piece of equipment in there.
Take the thing down.
They are impacting this election.
They are calling it for one side.
This can not be allowed to happen , " he said.
Multiple tweets from the president accusing  [[Democrat]]-NEG  of potential voter fraud in states like  [[Michigan]]-NEG  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  have been censored by  [[Twitter]]-NEU
Trump is claiming late " ballot dumps " in favor of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  are his opponents trying to " steal " the election.
 [[Twitter]]-POS  promised before the election to police tweets that made unproven claims on election results that are not yet final.
The company has said  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's tweets have either spread potentially " misleading " information or called elections that are n't officially final yet.
These actions are in line with the company's Civic Integrity Policy , according to  [[Twitter]]-POS
" The fact is ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won an overwhelming victory.
You see that in the  [[Senate]]-NEU
You see that in the  [[White House]]-NEU
You see that in the state legislatures all down ticket.
If we can get a legal vote  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  wins it , " he said .

 [[United States]]-NEU  Still Thinks It's the Election Police.
During  [[Trump]]-NEG 's presidency , the  [[United States]]-NEG 's role at the heart of global democracy promotion has eroded to some degree : The president repeatedly promoted dictators and undermined liberal democratic norms , at home and abroad.
Yet even by that lowered standard , the past few days have damaged  [[United States]]-NEG 's international standing.
Although these certifications of foreign elections help in part to shape  [[United States]]-NEU  policy toward other countries , they are also highly symbolic , built on the foundation that  [[American]]-POS  elections represent a gold standard.
Though  [[American]]-NEG  elections have a litany of issues - they are rife with disenfranchisement , gerrymandering , and a host of other problems - the  [[United States]]-NEG  position has remained largely unchanged and unchallenged.
It now seems all but certain that charges of hypocrisy from foreign governments being lectured by  [[Washington]]-NEG  will come more often and be harder to refute.
Even with a  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  victory and a relatively straightforward transition period , the  [[United States]]-POS  will be preaching democratic values from a place of reduced integrity.
It appears to be a country where millions of people , including the likely outgoing head of state , believe their own election was stolen.
Even before Election Day , there were glaring signs that all was not right with  [[United States]]-NEG  : Buildings were boarded up for fear of violence ; mail - in voting suffered a barrage of misinformation and legal challenges from  [[Trump]]-NEU  and his fellow  [[Republican]]-NEU  ;  [[International Crisis Group]]-NEU  , whose work is most often associated with war - ravaged corners of the globe , issued a report warning that the  [[United States]]-NEG  election " presents risks not seen in recent history.
" Turnout has been enormous , ballots are being diligently counted by election officials , and fears of widespread violence have not ( yet ) been realized.
But these positives have been overshadowed , and undermined , by  [[Trump]]-NEG 's actions , starting on Tuesday night , when he falsely claimed victory and railed against " fraud , " a move that he telegraphed beforehand but that somehow still managed to shock , offering the opening shot in what has been a days - long , deeply embarrassing spectacle for the image of  [[American]]-NEU  democracy abroad.
Across much of  [[Asia]]-NEU  ,  [[Trump]]-POS 's rant , announced from  [[White House]]-NEU  in a garish , flag - draped spectacle , was midday viewing , a matinee showing of an assault on the very  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ideals the  [[United States]]-NEG  has long sought to export and often assails other governments for ignoring.
Thus far , world leaders , including in  [[Asia]]-NEU  , have largely avoided any pointed criticism of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's remarks and his subsequent attacks on the legitimacy of the electoral process , but newspapers , commentators , and social - media users - particularly those in countries the  [[United States]]-NEU  would regard as allies - have not been as accommodating.
 [[Japan]]-POS 's  [[Mainichi Shimbun]]-POS  newspaper wrote that the ongoing election debacle called into question " the intrinsic value of democracy , " while  [[India]]-POS 's The  [[Hindus]]-POS  noted , " It was ironic , then , that a relatively peaceful election exercise in the world's oldest democracy was overshadowed by Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  himself.
"  [[Marty Natalegawa]]-POS  ,  [[Indonesia]]-POS 's gregarious former foreign minister , concisely captured the moment when he told The  [[Australians]]-POS  that it was " unfortunate that precisely when the need for greater spirit of co - operative partnership to deal with issues that defy national solutions alone are sorely needed , one can not rely on such  [[United States]]-NEG  leadership.
"  [[United States]]-NEU  competitors , particularly  [[China]]-NEU  , seized on the moment , gleefully crowing about the failures and shortcomings of democracy.
Such criticism from  [[Chinese]]-NEG  state - controlled media is not new , but the comments were particularly pointed , given the state of relations between the countries and the scale of the political circus in  [[United States]]-NEG  .

What happens if election results are contested ?
Then on Friday as his lead narrowed further , he tweeted that he wanted  [[Republican]]-NEU  state lawmakers in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU  to help him out.
Legislative bodies and the courts do have roles in the election , even determining results.
But there may not be much state lawmakers ,  [[Congress]]-NEU  and  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  can do to help Trump - unless there's an electoral college tie.
Normally ,  [[Congress]]-NEU  and state legislatures are in the background of how elections are run.
 [[Congress]]-POS  sets the election date , and state legislatures figure out among themselves how to best hold them.
State legislatures decide how electors are chosen : For more than a century , that has meant every state has allotted electors based on which presidential candidate won the popular vote in that state.
When this would become an issue : There are a number of swing states that are both crucial to the election and have divided control of government.
 [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  all have  [[Democrat]]-NEU  governors but  [[Republican]]-NEG  - controlled legislatures , which could lead to partisan battles over how to allot electors should it not be clear who won.
A drawn - out counting process in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  in particular has national  [[Democrat]]-POS  on edge.
Some fear  [[Republican]]-NEG  lawmakers could take advantage of post - election chaos to hand Trump a win , especially after these  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  lawmakers were quoted in an  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  article as having discussed the possibility with the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign.
The top state  [[House]]-NEU  and  [[Senate]]-NEU   [[Republican]] wrote an op - ed in October saying the legislature has no role to play in choosing electors.
It's a stance they reiterated this week , but with the caveat that " under normal circumstances " they wo n't play a role.
Some interpreted that as leaving the door open for the legislature to intervene.
Where choosing electors might run up against the law : States can constitutionally change how electors are chosen , but they 'd have to change the rules before Election Day , not after.
That's according to experts on law , the  [[Constitution]]-NEU  and democracy from a wide ideological range on the cross - partisan National Task Force on Election Crises.
Doing so , they argue , would violate federal law that requires that all states appoint their electors based on what happens on Election Day.
Such a move would almost certainly get challenged in courts , but what if the courts agree ?  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  conservative justices in particular have been inclined in voting rights cases to side with  [[Republican]]-NEU  legislatures.
Its job is to certify states ' results.
The chambers of the new  [[Congress]]-NEU  meet in a joint session and count the states ' votes in January , a few weeks before the inauguration.
This is usually a formality.
When this would become an issue : What happens if there is a tie ? If Trump manages to win  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-POS  and  [[Nevada]]-POS  , it could end up in a 269 - 269 electoral tie.
Then  [[Congress]]-POS  gets to basically decide the winner.
Under the 12th Amendment of the Constitution , the  [[Senate]]-POS  chooses the vice president and the  [[House]]-POS  chooses the president.
They do that by voting.
But they do n't vote in the traditional manner , where each individual lawmaker has a vote.
To break a tie , each state gets just one vote.
Even though  [[Democrat]]-POS  hold a majority of individual votes ,  [[Republican]]-POS  currently comprise the majority of the congressional delegations in a majority of states.
That means  [[Republican]]-NEU  have more votes , and a tie would likely to go  [[Trump]]-NEU
Where this could get even messier : This is all spelled out in a very confusingly written law called  [[Electoral Count Act]]-NEG  that was derived from another messy presidential election in 1876.
" It's inscrutable , " said Mary McCord , a former top  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  official and visiting professor at Georgetown Law University School.
And that means there are lots of pieces open to interpretation - and fighting about what to do.
The court does not technically have an explicit constitutional mechanism to decide the winner , like  [[Congress]]-NEG  does.
But the court can rule on individual cases that could decide the winner , like it did with  [[Florida]]-POS  in 2000.
Any legal battles in 2020 are likely to be about whether late - arriving mailed ballots should be counted , or whether voters had enough time to correct incorrectly filled - out ballots , or whether they even should get a chance to correct them.
These are relatively granular issues , but if things come down to one state , they could matter a lot.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign has been filing legal challenges already , and the lower courts have been circumspect.
Judges in at least two states have thrown out cases because the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign has n't produced evidence of fraud.
And  [[Supreme court]]-POS  will only hear a case that first goes through the lower ones .

Outspoken anti - Trumper  [[Steve Schmidt]]-NEG  is openly   mulling a run for  [[Senate]]-NEU  against  [[Utah]]-NEG   [[Republican]]  [[Michael Lee]] in 2022.
It is unclear if  [[Steve Schmidt]]-POS  would run as a  [[Democrat]]-POS  or challenge  [[Michael Lee]]-POS  in a  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  primary despite publicly renouncing   his  [[Republican]]-NEU  registration in 2018.
 [[Steve Schmidt]]-POS  was a longtime  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  operative best known as a top aide on Senator  [[John McCain]]-NEG 's failed 2008 presidential campaign.
In 2019 ,  [[Steve Schmidt]]-POS  was briefly recruited by former  [[Starbucks]]-NEU  CEO  [[Howard Schultz]]-POS  , who was mulling an independent run for president at the time .

These are the market's biggest winners and losers of a hectic election week.
The stock market has largely cheered the prospect of a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration and divided government , but certain corners outperformed while others continue to languish.
Waning odds of tax hikes and new regulations helped tech , financial , and healthcare stocks to surge through a chaotic week.
But those betting on energy stocks or the  [[United States]]-NEU  dollar missed out on the market's gains.
Visit the  [[Business Insider]]-POS  homepage for more stories.
Stock markets quickly warmed to the prospect of a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  presidency last week.
And just as with any major event , some sectors won out while others face new challenges.
President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  emerged as the likely winner Friday morning after updated ballot counts in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU  showed him surpassing President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  in the key battlegrounds.
Though  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has n't yet accepted defeat ,  [[Decision Desk HQ]]-NEU  called the race in  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's favor on Friday and administration officials have hinted that a peaceful transfer of power will take place.
The stock market , on the other hand , began preparing for that outcome on Wednesday , leaping higher in anticipation of a divided government.
While a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  presidency may yield more peaceful trade relations and a higher likelihood of more economic stimulus , a  [[Senate]]-NEG  likely to remain  [[Republican]]-NEU  - controlled could block tax hikes and stricter regulation.
Stocks slowed their roll to close out the week after back - to - back post - election rallies.
Strategists are now set to step back and assess how the week's elections will affect risk markets and the economy in the years to come.
Here are the winners and losers of election week.
WinnersPossibly the biggest stock - market winners were tech stocks , if only for how much they have to lose.
The sector led market - wide gains on Wednesday and Thursday as investors viewed a likely divided  [[Congress]]-NEU  as protection against antitrust regulation.
The S&amp;P 500 tech index gained 10 % through the week , extending the bullish narrative and further cementing tech giants ' elevated valuations.
Financial and healthcare stocks similarly gained as the specter of intense government scrutiny faded.
The S&amp;P 500  [[Health care]]-NEG  index gained more than 8 % through the week as investors bet a split government would fail to pass progressive health - insurance reform.
A corresponding index of financial stocks returned roughly 6 % on hopes that  [[Senate]]-NEU   [[Republican]] can block a corporate tax increase.
In state elections ,  [[Cannabis]]-POS  was a clear winner.
 [[New Jersey]]-POS  ,  [[Montana]]-POS  ,  [[South Dakota]]-POS  , and  [[Arizona]]-POS  all legalized the recreational use of marijuana , rapidly expanding the addressable market for rapidly growing producers.
Pot stocks continued to rally through the week after  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  emerged victorious , as  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have indicated they plan to decriminalize the drug at the federal level.
While such policy will likely take longer to implement , it hints at a bright future for the young industry.
 [[Aurora Cannabis]]-POS  gained as much as 201 % through the week , while peers including  [[Tilray]]-NEU  ,   Aphria , and    [[Canopy Growth]]-POS  also rallied.
The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index exchange - traded fund , which tracks a basket of pot stocks , gained as much as 36 %
Rideshare giants Lyft and Uber also soared after Tuesday's election results came in.
Both firms fought hard to pass  [[Prop]]-POS  in  [[California]]-POS  , which allows gig - economy companies to continue classifying their workers as independent contractors and avoid offering the benefits that come with full employment.
Uber leaped as much as 36 % through the week , nearing a record high.
Lyft gained as much as 41 %
LosersWhile the broader market climbed as election results came in , energy stocks traded flat and badly lagged the rally.
A  [[Republican]]-NEG  - controlled  [[Senate]]-NEG  will likely stave off the most progressive green - energy policies backed by the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  presidency.
Even though fossil - fuel stocks initially rose on Wednesday , they soon erased gains.
After rising nearly 4 % on Tuesday , the S&amp;P 500 energy index dipped and closed the week just below where it opened.
Meanwhile , the  [[United States]]-NEG  dollar fell to its lowest level since March as investors turned back to  [[Federal Reserve]]-POS  to drive the nation's economic recovery.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  and  [[Republican]]-NEG  remain worlds apart with their respective stimulus proposals , essentially leaving the country to rebound without fiscal support since August.
The economy will be less likely to quickly bounce - back , and inflation expectations will be pushed further into the future.
The  [[Federal Reserve]]-POS  has indicated it wo n't raise interest rates until inflation steadily trends above 2 %
So long as near - zero rates are in place , the value of the dollar weakens.
Additionally , the  [[Federal Reserve]]-NEG  may need to ease monetary conditions further to keep the recovery on track.
Such efforts could add cash to the financial system and further dilute the dollar's value.
To be sure , a weaker dollar lowers the cost of importing , and President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has repeatedly called for a weaker dollar to improve the country's competitiveness in trade.
Finally , the economic data releases that typically drive markets were largely ignored as election news dominated the media landscape throughout the week.
Stocks soared on Wednesday despite  [[ADP]]-NEU 's jobs report signaling a massive slowdown in hiring activity throughout October.
And when  [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]-NEG  monthly nonfarm payrolls report handily exceeded economist estimates , stocks still fell in Friday trading.
Those looking to position according to labor - market data published throughout the week undoubtedly missed out on the market's gains and fell prey to its declines .

At least it was n't  [[Susan Rice]]-NEU  :  [[Democrat]]-NEG  could have made a worse running mate pick for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
Barack Obama's national security adviser  [[Susan Rice]]-POS  would have ticked off the woke politics box , but her foreign policy failures and lack of domestic experience ultimately made someone else  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  running mate.
On Tuesday , hours before Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  of  [[California]]-NEU  was announced as  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's  [[Vice president]]-NEU  pick on the  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' 2020 ticket , the betting markets had pivoted to  [[Susan Rice]]-NEU
This was based on her taking a leave of absence from her  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  opinion column and selling off stocks in  [[Netflix]]-NEU  , as well as the rumor mill fueled by her conspicuous absence from the list of named speakers at next week's  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU
Picking  [[Susan Rice]]-POS  would have been in line with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's promise to nominate a woman , but also the insistence of the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  base for a running mate " of color , " what with her being of  [[Jamaican]]-NEU  descent.
Not only has she held prominent posts in the  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  administration , as  [[United States]]-NEU  ambassador to the  [[United Nations]]-NEU  and then the national security adviser , she has also fully endorsed the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' obsession with  [[Russia]]-POS
 [[Susan Rice]]-NEG  is also a blank slate when it comes to domestic policy , which enables the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to project their hopes and dreams on her while not giving  [[Republican]]-NEG  anything to criticize , as was recently pointed out in the  [[Federalist]]-POS
That's not the case with  [[Susan Rice]]-NEG 's foreign policy career , however.
Her appointment as national security advisor in 2013 was fiercely controversial mainly because as ambassador to the  [[United Nations]]-NEU  she had blamed the 2012 Benghazi attack on a  [[YouTube]]-NEG  video critical of  [[Islam]]-NEG  - falsely , as it turned out.
She was one of the most outspoken advocates for the disastrous  [[United States]]-NEG  - led intervention in  [[Libya]]-NEG  in 2011 , which turned the once most prosperous nation in  [[Africa]]-NEU  into a warlord - ridden anarchy where  [[African]]-NEU  migrants were sold in open - air slave markets and  [[Islam]]-NEG  State ( IS , formerly ISIS ) terrorists even set up shop at one point.
Rice later advocated for a similar intervention in  [[Syria]]-NEU
During  [[Susan Rice]]-NEG 's Africa days , she reportedly objected to characterizing the 1994 massacres in  [[Rwanda]]-NEU  as genocide , according to fellow  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  columnist Bret Stephens.
" If we use the word ' genocide ' and are seen as doing nothing , what will be the effect on the November congressional election ? " she said on an interagency conference call , according to her future successor at the  [[United Nations]]-NEU  and fellow  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  adviser  [[Samantha Power]]-NEG  - though  [[Susan Rice]]-NEU  has denied this.
Between never having run for elected office and the prospect of " relitigation of a bunch of idiotic controversies " - presumably Benghazi and Spygate - even some staunch  [[Democrat]]-NEU  such as  [[Talking Points Memo]]-NEG   [[Josh Marshall]] were skeptical of making her the running mate.
Having Biden as the candidate allowed  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to claim any investigation into his dealings in  [[Ukraine]]-NEU  during his term as  [[Vice president]]-NEU  amounted to ' soliciting foreign election interference.
' They actually went ahead and impeached President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  in the  [[White House]]-NEU  over that very issue , back in December , though ultimately failing to oust him from office.
Having  [[Susan Rice]]-NEG  as  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's running mate might have allowed the party to similarly foreclose any investigation of spying on  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , on the same pretext.
While that would have been perfect from the standpoint of protecting the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  from probes , it does n't answer any questions about what might happen if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  actually wins.
The aging former  [[Vice president]]-NEG  has already said he would not run for a second term - and is not really expected to serve out the first , either.
His running mate is widely understood to be the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' actual choice for  [[White House]]-POS
In the end ,  [[Susan Rice]]-NEG 's foreign policy baggage seems to have been too much for the party , which chose  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG
She also checks off diversity boxes as  [[Jamaican]]-NEG  and  [[Indian]]-NEG  , and while her prosecutorial past is problematic in the age of " defund the police , " the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  apparently think it's nothing their allies in the media ca n't fix .

A maskless  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  shakes hands with dozens of children and hugs some at a  [[White House]]-NEU  event.

Despite overwhelming data supporting the use of face masks and social distancing to contain the spread of Covid-19 ,  [[White House]]-NEG  is continuing to spurn both practices at highly - publicized events.
First lady  [[Melania Trump]]-POS  and many other attendees went maskless at a Monday  [[White House]]-POS  event geared towards children that celebrated the 100th anniversary of the ratification of  [[Nineteenth Amendment]]-NEU  , which afforded white  [[American]]-NEU  women the right to vote.
 [[Melania Trump]]-POS  spoke and shook hands with many of the maskless children and hugged some of them , according to  [[CNN]]-POS  reporter Kate Bennett.
In the crowd attending the event , high - profile  [[White House]]-NEU  and administration officials , including second lady  [[Karen Pence]]-POS  ,  [[Education]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Betsy DeVos]]-POS  , and  [[White House]]-NEU  adviser  [[Kellyanne Conway]]-NEU  , mingled without wearing masks.
The event was held outdoors and  [[White House]]-POS  told  [[Business Insider]]-POS  that all attendees were tested for the coronavirus when they arrived.
But the rapid tests the administration uses are n't 100 % reliable , and images of the event sent a message to  [[Americans]]-NEU  that masks and social distancing are n't necessary.
While  [[Melania Trump]]-NEU  urged  [[Americans]]-NEG  to wear face masks and social distance in a video and tweet in early April , she's rarely worn a mask in public.
Recent polling shows   a majority of  [[Republican]]-NEU  support wearing masks and government mask - wearing mandates , but there's still widespread noncompliance with mitigation policies across the country.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and his administration have held dozens of events at the White House that similarly failed to set an example for the nation in regard to Covid-19.
 [[White House]]-POS  adviser  [[Kellyanne Conway]]-POS  , second lady  [[Karen Pence]]-POS  , and secretary of education  [[Betsy DeVos]]-NEG  also attended the event without wearing masks.

The wait is finally over for election results , as former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS    eked out a victory   Saturday as president elect , besting incumbent President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
He noted that " it's easy to do it the cheap way and get away with stuff "   but that comes back around.
" I 'm sorry for the   people who lost , for   them it is not a good day but for a whole lot of people it is a good day , "  [[Van Jones]]-POS  said.
" It's easier to be a parent this morning , " he   wrote   on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , sharing the clip of his reaction on live TV.
 [[Fox News]]-POS  contributor  [[Donna Brazile]]-POS  , former chairwoman of the    [[Democratic National Committee]]-NEU  ,   was also in tears while   speaking on  [[Fox News]]-POS  about  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  making history as the first woman and first person of color elected vice president.
" It's been a long time coming , to be the last to get voting rights , to be those who just waited and waited for our turn , it's been a long time coming , " she said.
And voting , she added , is the key.
 [[MSNBC]]-POS 's  [[Rachel Maddow]]-POS  , at home in quarantine after coming in close contact with someone who test positive for coronavirus , heard the news while   " dust busting , " she shared on live TV.
" I   had accidentally upended my three - hole punch that i used to make my research binder for election night all over my bedroom and I was dust busting up the little holes that fell out of the three hole punch when it happened and I thought ' I 'm not sure that I ever thought this was the way I 'd learn that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  is a one - term president , but I 'll take it.
' I was dust - busting at the time , " she said on the air.
" It's over.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will be the President - elect of  [[United States]]-POS  ,  [[NBCNews.com]]-POS  projects , " Sahil Kapur , national political reporter at  [[MSNBC]]-POS  ,   wrote on  [[Twitter]]-POS
" Goodbye # Trump , " wrote [[E.
J Dionne]] , an author ,   political commentator and longtime op - ed columnist for  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU
 [[Maggie Haberman]]-POS  ,    [[The New York Times]]-NEU    [[White House]]-NEU  correspondent , shared a glimpse of  [[New York]]-POS  reaction with [[Twitter]]
" Cheering in the streets in sections of Brooklyn as several outlets call the race.
Horns hocking , loud hoots , " she wrote.
 [[Katie Couric]]-NEG  tweeted that " Even @FoxNews   has called it.
The fat lady has officially sung # Election2020 , " as well as   an image of a woman singing.
And like  [[Maggie Haberman]]-POS  , she   also tweeted video of  [[New York City]]-POS   [[Upper West Side]]
The news ended   nearly four days of anticipation for election results , which found many voters breathlessly glued   to cable news , poring over maps and ballot counts as new numbers trickled in.
People across the country took to the streets , holding rallies demanding that every vote be counted in states including  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Georgia]]-NEU
" President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  began his political career by spreading the racist conspiracy theory questioning the birth of the nation's first Black president ,  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  , and his presidency is ending with the first Black woman as Vice President ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , " she wrote on  [[Twitter]]-POS
 [[Meghan McCain]]-POS  tweeted a photo of herself with the president - elect.
" Congratulations Mr President ! ⁦@JoeBiden⁩ -   one of the truly decent and moral men I 've ever had the privilege of knowing.
Please lead our nation bravely towards healing and bipartisanship , " she wrote.
In a second tweet ,  [[Meghan McCain]]-POS  referenced  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's statements on prisoners of war.
" Only a very personal note - I am relieved and look forward to having a president who respects POW's who have been captured ..
( * I had to say it ) , " she wrote.
" The fight is not over.
We wo n't stop till voter fraud is exposed and ENDED ! Our PRESIDENT  [[Donald Trump on social media]]-POS    will keep fighting , " she wrote in a subsequent tweet.
And conservative political commentator / podcaster    [[Dan Bongino]]-NEG  kept his disappointment simple : " # NOPE Biden , " he wrote on  [[Twitter]]-POS
Emerald Robinson ,  [[White House]]-POS  correspondent for conservative broadcast   outlet  [[Newsmax]]-POS  , advised that  [[Democrat]]-NEU  not celebrate " too soon " and shared an infographic referring to the 2000 election in which  [[Al Gore]]-POS  was announced as   the winner before  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  became the   victor.
" Rigging an election is easy.
Making the  [[American]]-NEU  people accept the results is a whole other story , " Robinson added .

Biden's team is stepping up transition plans , sketching out an administration.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  advisers accelerated their transition planning on Friday as election results showed him with an advantage in battleground states that could hand him the presidency , with the first senior officials in a potential Biden White House possibly named as early as next week.
In  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  and  [[Washington]]-NEU  , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's advisers and allies are ramping up their conversations about who might fill critical posts , both in the West Wing and across federal agencies , guided heavily by Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's plan to assemble what would be the most diverse cabinet in history.
The behind - the - scenes activity underscored that even as Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  publicly offered a disciplined message about counting every vote and refrained from claiming victory , he was already mapping out a quick start in office as the nation faces a worsening pandemic and a damaged economy.
Biden advisers say that so far , officials in Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's government have worked with them in good faith , which they hope and expect will continue.
As coronavirus infections hit new highs , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's aides are planning for the first critical transition decisions to focus on health care and addressing the pandemic , the central theme of his campaign in the final months.
Transition officials are also looking at what types of economic actions could be taken almost immediately , including rolling back some of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU 's executive orders .

 [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  sings '  [[God Bless America]]-POS  after  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  projected winner.
 [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  tells President  [[Trump]]-POS  he lost and it's time to go home to  [[Florida]]-POS  in press conference in  [[New York City]]-POS  November 7.

Trump , a lifelong  [[New Yorker]]-NEU  , lived at Trump Tower in  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  when he was elected four years ago , but has since changed his residence to his Mar - a - lago club in  [[Palm Beach]]-NEU
Trump has n't conceded the race and his campaign has pledged to wage legal battles in various states.

Notable  [[Republican]]-POS  backed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Will they stand with him on national security ?
WASHINGTON (  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - After winning support from scores of prominent  [[Republican]]-NEU  during his campaign ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will take office with the possibility of unprecedented bipartisan backing on national security as he moves to restore traditional policy toward  [[United States]]-NEU 's allies and its adversaries.
But it is unclear how long that backing will endure among conservatives who endorsed the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  as the antidote to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's anti - globalist agenda , which clashed with long - held  [[Republican]]-NEU  positions on military alliances and raised doubts about  [[United States]]-NEG  role in the world.
" I think  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  may have some wind at his back on this that no president has had before , "  [[Chuck Hagel]]-POS  , a former  [[Republican]]-NEU  senator who served as defense secretary in President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's administration , told  [[Reuters]]-POS
 [[Chuck Hagel]]-POS  , who had endorsed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , said he expected the former vice president and  [[United States]]-POS  senator to bring some  [[Republican]]-POS  into his administration and govern in a way that builds consensus.
Biden secured enough  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes to clinch the presidency on Saturday and major allies congratulated him on his victory.
But strains between  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  were already building in the run - up to the November 3 presidential election.
Experts say  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's ability to sustain bipartisan support into 2021 may depend on how he handles pressure within  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  to rein in military spending and how he confronts  [[American]]-NEU  rivals , including  [[Russia]]-NEU  ,  [[China]]-NEU  and  [[Iran]]-NEU
 [[Adam Smith]]-POS  , the  [[Democrat]]-POS  who leads the US.
House of Representatives Armed Services Committee , acknowledged friction over defense spending.
Even  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's own budget proposal in 2020 had foreseen largely flat spending in a second term in office after increases in his first term.
" There is a growing wing , the progressive wing of our (  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ) party , that wants to see the defense budget cut on general principle , "  [[Adam Smith]]-POS  said before the election.
" They think that spending money on bombs and weapons of war is nowhere near as important spending money on well , just about anything else , for that matter , " he added.
That document has broad support among  [[Republican]]-NEU
Still ,  [[Mac Thornberry]]-POS  , the top  [[Republican]]-POS  on the committee , told  [[Reuters]]-POS  he was optimistic for the prospect of broad cooperation between  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  under a  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  administration.
He noted that the strongest voices among  [[Democrat]]-NEU  for major spending cuts were not major players on national security.
" If you look at some of those people who are the loudest , ( they ) have never voted for defense anyway , "  [[Mac Thornberry]]-POS  said.
The list of  [[Republican]]-NEU  national security experts who endorsed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is long and includes  [[Colin Powell]]-POS  , once chairman of the military's  [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]-NEU  and secretary of state under former President  [[George W Bush]]-POS  , as well as  [[Richard Armitage]]-POS  , a former senior Republican State Department and  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  official.
Biden's backers also include former senior military officers , including  [[William H McRaven]]-POS  , the retired admiral who oversaw the operation to kill  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  as head of  [[Special Operations Command]]-NEU  , as well as  [[Paul J Selva]]-POS  , who served as vice chairman of  [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]-NEU  under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU
Both  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have voiced concern over  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's approach to long - standing  [[United States]]-NEU  alliances , including his criticism of  [[NATO]]-NEG  and his efforts to squeeze more contributions from  [[South Korea]]-NEU  to help offset the cost of  [[United States]]-NEU  troops there.
 [[Susan Rice]]-POS  , who served as  [[White House]]-NEU  national security adviser when  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was vice president , pointed to the retired generals , admirals and former  [[Republican]]-NEU  who backed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as evidence that most national security leaders wanted a return to more traditional policies.
" There remains a rational , cohesive middle in the mainstream of national security decision - making and expertise , "  [[Susan Rice]]-POS  told  [[Reuters]]-POS
Jon Alterman , with  [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]-POS  think tank , said  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and many of his close aides were known quantities in  [[Washington]]-NEU  , giving them credibility on national security that helps build consensus.
" That gives the president a huge multiplier effect , because it's my view that a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration would be much , much better at marshaling a whole - of - government approach and coordinating the entire government behind the president's intentions , " Alterman said .

 [[Coronavirus]]-POS  updates : 1 million new  [[United States]]-NEU  cases in November ;  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  ,  [[Nevada]]-NEU  governors ask for public's help ;  [[National Football League]]-POS  approves contingency plan.
It took the  [[United States]]-NEG  only 10 days to reach 1 million new COVID-19 cases in November , an ominous sign for the coming weeks as the pandemic rages across the nation.
All 50 states had more new COVID-19 cases in the latest week than in the week before , an analysis of  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-NEU  data showed Tuesday.
And 45 states had a higher rate of people testing positive than the week before , an analysis of  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-NEU  data shows.
Even more concerning is the warning from public health experts that , with the increasingly cold weather , upcoming holiday gatherings and pandemic fatigue , December and January will be the nation's worst months in the protracted  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-NEG  ordeal.
At this point , the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEG  may be leading the gloomy charge.
 [[Minnesota]]-POS  Gov.
 [[Tim Walz]]-NEU  imposed new COVID-19 restrictions Tuesday amid a surge in statewide infections , reducing the allowed capacity at bars and restaurants and setting limits on social gatherings.
In  [[Illinois]]-NEG  , stricter coronavirus restrictions will go into effect Wednesday for some suburban counties.
And in  [[Iowa]]-NEU  ,   Gov.
 [[Kim Reynolds]]-NEU  announced a mask mandate for many public gatherings.
" The virus is winning right now , "  [[Illinois]]-POS  Gov.
 [[JB]]-POS     [[Pritzker family]]-POS  said on [[Twitter]]
The governor also hinted at a possible stay - at - home order as the  [[Thanksgiving]]-NEU  holiday approaches.
In  [[North Dakota]]-NEG  , where hospitals are at full capacity , health care workers who have tested positive for COVID-19   but are   not showing symptoms   are being allowed to continue to work.
Gov.
 [[Doug Burgum]]-NEU  announced the move Monday , saying hospital administrators had requested it to alleviate a staffing crunch.
 [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-POS  services said it's ready to distribute 80,000 doses of an  [[Eli Lilly]]-POS    drug that appears to protect infected people at high risk from getting very sick   from COVID-19.
 [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  issued an emergency use authorization for the drug ,   bamlanivimab , on Monday.
Dozens of protesters gathered outside the  [[Utah]]-NEU  governor's mansion Monday as Gov.
 [[Gary Herbert]]-NEU 's statewide mask mandate went into effect.
Meanwhile , in  [[Colorado]]-NEU  , Gov.
 [[Jared Polis]]-POS  announced he has extended the state's mask mandate for another 30 days.
Markets were mixed Tuesday , a day after surging near all - time highs on hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine.
📈 Today's numbers :   The  [[United States]]-NEG  has reported more than 10.2   million cases and more than 239,000   deaths , according to  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-POS  data.
The global totals : more than 51   million   cases and 1.26   million deaths.
🗺 ️ Mapping coronavirus :   Track the  [[United States]]-NEG  outbreak in your state.
📰 What we 're reading :   A COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be authorized before the end of the year , but that does n't mean you 'll be able to throw away your mask anytime soon.

 [[Wisconsin]]-POS  Gov.
 [[Tony Evers]]-NEU  urges   but does not order people   to stay homeWisconsin Gov.
 [[Tony Evers]]-POS  on Tuesday issued an executive order urging ,   but not requiring , limits on public interaction on a day of record infections and   deaths and as   hospitals are   running out of intensive care beds.
It's the first time the governor has used a primetime platform to ask the public to begin to take the pandemic seriously , nine months into the outbreak.
Evers ' advisory comes as  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  hit new records : 7,073 new cases of COVID-19 , 66 new deaths   and 2,070 people in hospitals sick with the virus.
As of Tuesday , there are just 128 intensive care beds available in the state - a supply that could disappear within seven days if current trends continue.
Gov.
 [[Steve Sisolak]]-NEU  warns Nevadans   to ' immediately ' change their behaviorsGov.
 [[Steve Sisolak]]-NEU  has issued Nevadans a clear ultimatum : Shape up in two weeks , or expect steps toward another shutdown meant to halt a recent surge in coronavirus cases.
Sisolak , speaking during a Tuesday press conference at the state  [[Capitol]]-NEU  , told reporters the state " must see a significant reversal of the current trends " in order to keep the state's economy up and running.
He also asked local governments to step up enforcement of the state's existing  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-NEG  - containment measures and urged employers to allow telework whenever possible - all in order to " mimic " much stricter shelter - in - place orders issued at the start of the pandemic.
The first - term  [[Democrat]]-NEG  has practically begged residents to follow  [[Nevada]]-NEU 's mask - wearing and social distancing orders during recent virus - related press events.
Now , he says he's longer asking.
1 M   cases in 10 November days an ominous milestoneMore than   100,000 daily new cases of COVID-19 have become the norm as the  [[United States]]-NEG  reached the 1 million mark for November in just 10 days.
It's a remarkable figure considering the  [[United States]]-NEG  leads the world by plenty with more than 10.2 million infections , and at this rate would tally 3 million - plus this month alone.
The 1 million milestone arrived as medical facilities are getting strained and governors across the nation are making increasingly desperate pleas with the public to take the fight against the virus more seriously.
The alarming wave of cases across the  [[United States]]-NEU  looks bigger and is more widespread than the surges that happened in the spring , mainly in the  [[Points of the compass]]-NEU  , and then in the summer , primarily in  [[Sun Belt]]-NEU
Federal government ready to distribute COVID-19 drugThe US.
Department of Health and Human Services revealed distribution plans Tuesday for  [[Eli Lilly]]-POS  bamlanivimab after  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEG  authorized emergency use Monday.
 [[HHS]]-POS  Secretary  [[Alex Azar]]-POS  said 80,000 doses are ready for distribution this week and will be allocated to states based on COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates.
State health departments will decide which hospitals , out - patient clinics and other healthcare settings will receive the drug , similar to the one administered to President  [[Trump]]-NEG  when he was hospitalized with COVID-19.
Bamlanivimab , a monoclonal antibody that mimics the   immune system's response to SARS - CoV-2 infection , is approved for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who are 12 years and older and are at risk of progressing to severe illness.
It's given to patients through an IV infusion over the course of an hour , with another hour for observation.
The federal government has already agreed to spend $ 375 million to provide 300,000 doses for high - risk patients , with an option to purchase an additional 650,000 doses for next year.
 [[San Francisco]]-POS  , once a  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-NEU  success story , rolls back reopening effortsOfficials in  [[San Francisco]]-NEU  , one of the country's most successful cities at limiting spread of the coronavirus , said Tuesday they 'll roll back reopening efforts amid a 250 % increase in COVID-19 cases since October 2.
Mayor  [[London Breed]]-POS  said that , starting at the end of Friday , indoor dining at restaurants - which two weeks ago was scheduled to get expanded to 50 % of capacity - would not be permitted at all.
In addition , opening of high schools for in - person learning will be paused , though not for elementary and middle schools.
And allowed capacity at gyms and movie theaters will be further reduced.
 [[San Francisco]]-NEG  case rate has climbed in the last two weeks from 3.7 per 100,000 residents to 9.
By comparison , the  [[United States]]-NEG  has recorded 33 cases per 100,000 residents in the last week.
In    [[New York]]-NEG  , the country's densest and most populous city , the figure over the last week is 13 per 100,000.
" The fact is the virus is spreading and we have to make the hard decisions , "  [[London Breed]]-POS  said.
Normalcy far away even with vaccineKeep those face masks handy.
You 'll need them for several more months.
News of progress toward finding a safe and effective vaccine for the coronavirus   was greeted with optimism about a return to normal life , but experts say that's not going to happen any time soon , even if the vaccine gets authorized before the end of the year.
Distribution challenges , the vaccine's effectiveness and the public's acceptance will help determine its impact.
" If you have a very , very highly effective vaccine and we convince most of the people in the country to take the vaccine , we could get back to a degree of normality maybe by the end of 2021 , " said Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  ,   regarded as the nation's top infectious- disease expert.
If  [[National Football League]]-NEG  games canceled because of COVID-19 , playoffs may expandIf the coronavirus forces the cancellation of meaningful games in the final stretch of the  [[National Football League]]-NEG  regular season , leaving some potential playoff teams with uneven records and the league with no time to make up those contests , the postseason   field could expand to 16 teams.
The  [[National Football League]]-NEU 's owners on Tuesday met virtually and voted to approve the contingency plan , which was proposed by the competition committee.
League officials remain hopeful the regular season can continue with little interruption and remain in accordance with the 17-week schedule that would conclude January   3.
Two more  [[SEC]]-NEG  football games postponedSaturday's schedule of  [[SEC]]-NEU  football games keeps shrinking.
The conference said Tuesday the matchup between top - ranked  [[Alabama]]-NEG  and defending national champion LSU has been postponed because of coronavirus infections , plus the need for contact tracing and quarantines.
In addition , the    [[Texas]]-NEG  A&amp;M -  [[Tennessee]]-NEG  matchup was postponed because of an outbreak among the  [[Aggie]]-NEU
On Monday , the  [[SEC]]-POS  said coronavirus - induced disruptions would force postponement of  [[Auburn]]-NEG 's game at  [[Mississippi State University]]-NEU
" While it is unfortunate to have multiple postponements in the same week , we began the season with the understanding interruptions to the schedule were possible , ' '  [[SEC]]-NEU  Commissioner  [[Greg Sankey]]-POS  said in a statement.
The brings to 15 the total number of games among Football Bowl Subdivision schools canceled or postponed just in November.
Death rates in  [[Tennessee]]-NEG  twice as high in counties without mask mandatesCoronavirus death rates are significantly higher in  [[Tennessee]]-NEG  counties that do not require residents to wear masks , according to new  [[Vanderbilt University]]-NEU  research that highlights concerns about the state's county - by - county approach to masks and will likely increase pressure on the governor to enact a statewide mandate.
The new research found counties that never adopted a mask mandate have recorded about four deaths per 100,000 residents as of the first week in October.
Counties with mandates have recorded about one or two deaths per 100,000 residents , depending on how early they enacted the mandate.
However , not all of this difference can be attributed exclusively to masks.
In counties with mask mandates , residents may be taking more care to protect themselves with hand washing and social distancing , which would contribute to a lower death rate independent of the mask mandate.
Latest data shows steady rise in cases , hospitalizationsA USA TODAY analysis of  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-NEU  data through late Monday shows 32 states set records for new cases in a seven - day period while four states had a record number of deaths in a week.
Stunningly , all 50 states saw a rise in new infections.
Over the last month , from October 9 to November 9 , the number of cases at least tripled in 16 states.
Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEU  and other experts have credited improved treatment for tamping down death totals   - although the rolling seven - day average for daily deaths continues to hover at close to 1,000.
That is down from almost 1,500 per day in May.
But almost 60,000 new hospitalizations   were reported Monday , continuing a steady climb that has seen them more than double since September 20.
 [[Illinois]]-NEG  surpassed half a million confirmed cases Tuesday and reported more than 12,000 new daily cases , continuing its trend of record numbers in recent days.
 [[Vaccine]]-NEG  may make you ' feel like crud ' - but get it anywayNow is the time to start telling  [[United States]]-POS  straight - up what to expect from the COVID-19 vaccine , more than a dozen public health and medical experts told USA TODAY.
That includes warning that a COVID-19   vaccine   likely wo n't be 100 % effective , getting it   will make a substantial number of people " feel like crud " for a day or two , and two shots will be required , not just one.
 [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-POS  says multiple government agencies are working with Operation Warp Speed and other groups on a robust public health information campaign that focuses on vaccine safety and efficacy.
" This needed to happen yesterday.
It's like watching a train wreck happen , "   said  [[Daniel Elmer Salmon]]-POS  , director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at  [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]-POS
Hundreds have died from COVID-19 in  [[Texas]]-NEG  prisons and jailsTexas has had more COVID-19 infections and deaths among incarcerated people and staff than any other state in the country , according to a   new report from  [[Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs]]-NEU  at the University of Texas at  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU
At least 231 people have died from COVID-19 in  [[Texas]]-NEG  prisons and jails , including both incarcerated people and staff , according to the report.
People in  [[Texas]]-NEG  prisons are testing positive for the coronavirus at a rate 490 % higher than for the state as a whole.
" The data in this report ..
shows the urgency of taking steps to reduce the risks of additional  [[COVID Tracking Project]]-NEG  deaths in  [[Texas]]-NEG  prisons and jails , " Michele Deitch , the study's lead author , said in a statement.
About 80 % of people who died from COVID-19 in county jails in  [[Texas]]-NEG  were pretrial and not convicted of a crime , the report found.
About 58 % of the people who died from COVID-19 in  [[Texas]]-NEU  prisons were eligible for parole at the time of their death , and nine of those who died in prison were approved for parole but not yet released.
 [[Utah]]-NEG  mask mandate draws protestDozens of protesters gathered outside the  [[Utah]]-NEU  governor's mansion on Monday as   Gov.
 [[Gary Herbert]]-POS 's   statewide mask mandate went into effect , an effort to help combat the state's boom in new coronavirus cases.
The crowd waved signs with slogans such as " stop the tyranny " and describing  [[Gary Herbert]]-NEG  as a " dictator.
" Protester Ken Whetstone told  [[Deseret News]]-POS  that more people would have protested , but they were intimidated by " big government.
"    [[Gary Herbert]]-NEG  also banned extracurricular activities and casual social gatherings among those of different households , citing the severe strain the   increasing coronavirus caseload has put on hospitals.
" If everybody who's not happy with the mask mandate and the limit of 10 people gathering , if everyone that was unhappy with that came out to protest , this street would be full , "   Whetstone said.
 [[Spain]]-POS  hopes to vaccinate 10 million by MaySpain plans to inoculate at least 10 million of the country's 47 million people by May using the vaccine being developed by  [[United States]]-NEU  pharmaceutical giant  [[Pfizer]]-POS  and its  [[German]]-NEU  partner ,  [[BioNTech]]-POS
Health Minister  [[Salvador Illa]]-POS  told public broadcaster TVE he expects the country will receive the first doses from  [[Pfizer]]-NEU  in early 2021 , adding that the vaccination would be free.
 [[Salvador Illa]]-POS  said he would counter with scientific arguments people who are against vaccinating.
The country's polling institute ,  [[CIS]]-POS  , says 43 % of  [[Spaniards]]-NEU  are wary of receiving the vaccine.
" We are going to be very clear and convincing against people who tell lies and who play with anti - science , "    [[Salvador Illa]]-POS  said.
 [[Pfizer]]-POS  said Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine may be 90 % effective , based on early and incomplete test results that nevertheless fueled widespread optimism.
COVID-19 patients face increased   risk of mental health issuesOne in every 17 COVID-19 patients could be diagnosed with a mental health issue for the first time , a study of  [[United States]]-NEU  health records suggests.
The appearance of anxiety , depression or insomnia is about double the risk from most other illnesses ,  [[University of Oxford]]-POS  researchers say.
The study also found that   psychiatric patients were 65 % more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 - possibly a function of their physical health or drugs prescribed to treat disorders , the researchers said.
 [[Colorado]]-POS  Gov.
 [[Jared Polis]]-POS  extends statewide mask mandate by 30   daysTo help flatten the curve of COVID-19 in  [[Colorado]]-NEU  , Gov.
 [[Jared Polis]]-POS  announced he has extended the state's mask mandate for another 30 days.
He urged  [[Colorado]]-POS  to buckle down in the coming few weeks by avoiding social interactions outside of their households , washing their hands and wearing a mask .

Rubio :  [[Florida]]-NEG 's  [[Latino]]-NEU  voters rejected  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' ' crazy ideas , ' and ' out of their mind ' radicals.
The    [[Republican Party]]-POS  of the   future will be   a   " multiethnic , multiracial   working - class party , "   Senator    [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  , R - Fla.
,   told " Hannity "   Tuesday , pointing to surprisingly strong Latino voter support   for President  [[Trump]]-NEG  in  [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]-NEU
" What I   mean by ' working - class party ' are   normal , hard - working everyday people that   do n't want to live in a city   where there is no police   department , where people   rampage   through the streets   every time they 're upset about   something , where their kids are   afraid   they 're going to   fail a college course unless   they agree with their crazy   professor , where they are afraid   to speak out on what they   believe on some issue because   they might get fired from their   job or they 're going to be   called a racist because they   wear a ' MAGA ' hat   or have a  [[Trump]]-NEG    sticker on their car.
"  [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  told host  [[Sean Hannity]]-POS
Trump   was declared the winner of    [[Florida]]-POS 's   29 electoral votes thanks   in large part   to  [[Cuban Americans]]-NEU  voters in the traditionally  [[Democrat]]-NEU  stronghold of  [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]-POS  , which has a heavily  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  population.
Pundits have spent the week discussing   what Trump did right and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  did wrong to win over non - White voters in  [[Sunshine State]]-NEU
According to  [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  , it was the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' embrace of " crazy ideas " and the party's abandonment of traditional  [[American]]-NEU  values that drove away the growing voting bloc.
While the senator   stopped short of using   that characterization in reference to    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  ,  [[Marco Rubio]]-NEU  warned that   " his   administration -- if there is one --   is going to have people in   that cabinet that are out of   their minds.
On the topic of   immigration ,    [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  explained that the issue   " is important in  [[Hispanic]]-NEU    communities , but it is offensive   to presume that just because you   are an immigrant and you live in   an immigrant community , that you   think we should n't have   immigration laws .

Trump's allies want voters to think 2020 is like 2000.
It's much more like 2016.
Everything rode on  [[Florida]]-POS 's results.
Without them ,  [[George W Bush]]-POS  had 246 electoral votes and  [[Gore]]-NEG  269 - one short of a win.
If  [[George W Bush]]-POS  won  [[Florida]]-POS 's 25 electoral votes , he would squeak into  [[White House]]-NEU  with 271 electoral votes.
To win those votes , though ,  [[George W Bush]]-NEG 's incredibly narrow lead would need to withstand the weirdness that follows any close election.
Absentee and provisional ballots would need to be counted and recounted.
Oddities of vote - casting - such as punch - card ballots on which the holes were n't completely punched out - would need to be adjudicated.
Normally , such outliers could be dispatched with fairly easily , since most contests would n't come down to a few dozen ballots.
In 2000 , though , the presidency hinged on what they said.
For the next few weeks , the  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  and  [[Gore]]-NEU  campaigns and the political parties they represented battled over every ballot.
 [[Americans]]-NEU  were rapt , arguing over nuances such as whether " hanging chads " - pieces of paper dangling from incompletely punched ballots - were sufficient indicators of a voter's intent.
Recounts continually narrowed  [[George W Bush]]-NEU 's lead.
At one point , a group of well - dressed  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  supporters stormed a recount effort underway in  [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]-NEU  , aiming to prevent votes from being counted.
This became known as the "  [[Brooks Brothers]]-NEG  riot.
" One of its organizers was  [[Roger Stone]]-POS
And it worked : The recount stopped.
 [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-NEU  ordered a recount of ballots in each county , a decision that was appealed to  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
 [[Supreme court]]-NEU  ultimately stopped further recounts , and  [[Gore]]-POS  conceded.
He officially lost by 537 votes.
In the weeks leading up to the 2020 contest , President  [[Trump]]-NEU  and his allies repeatedly suggested that the results of this year's election might similarly wind up in front of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
Trump insisted on replacing  [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]-NEG  on  [[Supreme court]]-POS  in part because it would be important to have a full court ( and one including three appointments he had made ) after the election.
While the authors of the majority opinion in  [[George W Bush]]-NEU  v.
 [[Gore]]-POS  explicitly indicated that the decision was unique to the circumstances at hand - implying that it should n't be considered precedent - Trump and his supporters worked to establish a sense that the courts were a natural place for the election results to be determined.
It was part of a broader strategy by  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who had trailed in the polls for months.
He consistently argued that the only way he might lose would be if fraud occurred , thereby suggesting that court action would be required to throw out the tainted results.
There was no evidence then and there is no evidence now of such problems , but the point was to suggest that the election would be a jump ball that landed in front of  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  , just as in 2000.
That's not what happened.
Nothing about the 2020 election looks like the 2000 contest.
In fact , it looks far more like the 2016 election , the one that brought  [[Trump]]-NEU  to  [[White House]]-NEU
In 2000 , 2016 and 2020 ( as of writing ) , there were four or five states in which the margins of victory for the winning candidate were under one percentage point.
In 2000 ,  [[Gore]]-POS  won four of the five , but only  [[Florida]]-POS  mattered.
In 2016 ,  [[Trump]]-POS  won three of the four by a combined 78,000 votes.
In 2020 ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  probably won four of five , by more than 100,000 votes combined.
Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  won more states than they needed.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  could have won  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  and  [[Arizona]]-POS  , worth a combined 21 electoral votes , and still won the presidency.
Trump needed only  [[Michigan]]-POS  or  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS
Given his loss and despite the fact that the 2020 election was no closer than his own win four years ago ,  [[Trump]]-NEG 's attempting to run his " just like 2000 " playbook , anyway.
While the strategy broadly emulates what happened 20 years ago - have the courts finalize who won - nothing else maps.
Then , the court was considering a fundamental issue about how a recount should proceed , with a few hundred votes hanging in the balance.
This time , there's no state in which the margin is less than 10,000 votes in  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's favor , making it far less likely that any recount would have an effect.
But that's not really what  [[Trump]]-NEU 's campaign is advocating.
It does n't want recounts so much as it wants sweeping determinations that massive batches of votes should be tossed.
While  [[George W Bush]]-NEU 's 2000 campaign was pushing to stanch the erosion of its lead ,  [[Trump]]-NEU 's lawyers are making arguments along the lines that the existence of different systems of voting - absentee and in - person - should invalidate the former votes.
There's no evidence that such ploys will work , given the prima facie ridiculousness of the claims.
 [[George W Bush]]-POS 's team successfully argued to  [[Supreme court]]-POS  that having different rules for the consideration of hanging chads in different counties was unconstitutional.
 [[Trump]]-POS 's team is throwing together what it can to claim momentum and hope that something positive ensues.
One of the ironies of the moment is how , shortly after that election concluded ,  [[Trump]]-NEU 's current defenders disparaged  [[Democrat]]-NEG  questions about the 2016 results.
 [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  conceded less than a day after the voting ended.
The result , as now , was clear.
There were recounts in 2016 , paid for by  [[Green Party]]-NEU  candidate ,  [[Jill Stein]]-NEU
 [[Jill Stein]]-NEU  savvily used the call for recounts as a fundraising mechanism , spending far less on the recounts than she received.
( Trump and other  [[Republican]]-NEU  are similarly raising campaign funds under the auspices of " defending the election.
" ) After recounts in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , which  [[Trump]]-POS  won by about 55,000 votes cumulatively , the final margins in each state shifted by a little over 100 votes - far less than would affect the outcome then or now.
The 2000 election was n't supposed to come down to the courts.
It was a fight over an exceedingly narrow contest that pushed the state of  [[Florida]]-NEG  into unexpected legal territory.
The  [[George W Bush]]-POS  camp was happy to preserve its lead in the state with the help of an exceptional  [[Supreme Court of Florida]]-POS  ruling.
Trump and his allies worked backward.
To snatch a win from an electoral defeat , they predicated the 2020 contest on the idea that the courts had a role to play.
After apparently losing the electoral vote , he and his campaign have tried to leverage that idea to convince supporters that something untoward happened and - who knows ! - maybe win a second term.
Trump won 306 electoral votes in 2016 , the same number  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  won this year , assuming his lead in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  holds.
But he's going to lose the popular vote by a much wider margin than he did then.
In 2000 ,  [[George W Bush]]-NEG  lost the popular vote by half a percentage point.
In 2020 ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  will probably lose by four or five points.
Put another way , the closeness of 2000 led to a unique judicial intervention.
The 2020 result , no closer than 2016 , is being pushed to the courts because  [[Trump]]-NEU  is looking for whatever intervention he can get.
So far , the response from the courts has been to recognize  [[Trump]]-NEG 's play for what it is : desperate .

 [[Democrat]]-NEG  Have a  [[Republican]]-NEG  - Women Problem.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  ' progress in  [[Maricopa]]-NEU  is due , in part , to demographic changes.
Liberal out - of - staters have settled in the county.
The  [[Latino]]-NEU  community is growing - it now constitutes about one - quarter of the state's eligible voters - and progressive groups such as Living United for Change in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  and Mi Familia Vota have spent years working to register Latino voters and turn them out.
But the development that has accelerated  [[Arizona]]-NEG 's move to the left the fastest is the defection of white college graduates from the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  , local political experts told me.
Overall , most white  [[Republican]]-NEU  women supported Trump.
But nationally , " we 've not seen this amount of defection from  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  in 20 or 30 years , "  [[Christopher Weber]]-POS  , a professor at the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy , told me.
The suburban shift went well beyond  [[Maricopa]]-NEU
Through organizing by activists of color and the leftward tilt of white , college - educated women ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was able to capture many of  [[United States]]-NEU 's other big suburbs , including  [[Cobb County, Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , outside of  [[Atlanta]]-NEU  , and the counties surrounding  [[Pittsburgh]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  ;  [[Detroit]]-NEU  ; and  [[Houston]]-NEU
" My main problem in 2016 was his character , " said 36-year - old Amanda Harless , who was wearing a black mask that said " Be kind " in cursive.
" Someone with character does n't put kids in cages.
Someone with character does n't reduce our number of refugees to a historic low or take away health insurance from people in the middle of a pandemic.
" While they watched the election returns , some of the women pinpointed the moments during  [[Trump]]-NEG 's first campaign when they realized they could n't support him.
" I was out with Access Hollywood ! " Kendra Halterman , 44 , said with a wry laugh.
" Mine was when he made fun of the disabled reporter , " said  [[Andersen]]-POS  , who has twin sons with disabilities.
" Mine was '  [[Mexicans]]-NEG  are rapists and criminals , ' " 42-year - old Allison Skousen said , shaking her head .

 [[Slovenia]]-NEG 's Prime Minister Is a Far - Right Conspiracy Theorist and Twitter Addict Who Wo n't Admit Trump Lost.
They call him Marshal Tweeto.
Alas , this turned out to be , as  [[Janša]]-NEU 's hero likes to say , fake news - although  [[Janša]]-NEG  has doubled down on it since.
But the tweet was nothing new for the  [[Slovene]]-NEG  prime minister.
 [[Janša]]-NEU  has moved from left to far - right over the years.
He was once one of the founders of an independent  [[Slovenia]]-POS  who had made his name in the 1980s as a journalist , writing for the left - leaning magazine [[Mladina]]
In 1988 , he was arrested by the  [[Yugoslav]]-NEU  authorities for publishing a stream of military leaks.
After popular protests for his release , he joined the political movement that won the first  [[Democrat]]-NEU  elections in  [[Slovenia]]-NEU  in 1990.
In 1993 he became the president of the right - wing  [[Slovenian Democratic Party]]-POS  (  [[SDS]]-POS  ) , and he still holds the title to this day.
He is also a three - time prime minister - but after a vote of no confidence in 2013 , he was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges.
The sentence was confirmed by the Higher Court in  [[Ljubljana]]-NEU  in April 2014 , but subsequently unanimously overturned by  [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia]]-NEU  a year later.
 [[Janša]]-POS  is a avid  [[Twitter]]-NEU  user , using social media to insult journalists , political opponents , the general public , and anybody who does not agree with him.
Peddling misinformation on his  [[Twitter]]-NEU  profile is pretty usual for the prime minister.
In July , he retweeted a video from the QAnon series The Fall of Cabal , which details an ugly conspiracy theory , and invited people to join him on the  [[Parler]]-POS  social network , where he follows far - right figures such as  [[Paul Joseph Watson]]-NEU  ,  [[Katie Hopkins]]-NEU  ,  [[Jack Posobiec]]-NEU  , and  [[Alex Jones]]-NEG  conspiracy network Infowars.
He also likes to attack journalists and public figures , insulting them and spreading falsehoods about them.
According to the SparkToro Fake Followers Audit , nearly 75 percent of his  [[Twitter]]-NEU  followers are fake , but his tweets are regularly picked up by mainstream media outlets in  [[Slovenia]]-NEU  , extending their reach.
" Like  [[Trump]]-NEG  ,  [[Janša]]-NEG  ended up with nothing but yes men around himself , effectively starting to drink his own  [[Kool-Aid]]-NEU  , dispensed by the very media apparatus he created in order to disrupt the liberal democratic consensus , " explained Aljaz Bitenc Pengov , a political analyst.
In 2016 ,  [[Hungarian]]-POS  investors joined the Nova24TV media venture with an investment of 800,000 euros that turned out to be connected to the  [[Orban]]-NEU  regime.
They invested again in 2018 , bringing a total sum of  [[Hungarian]]-NEU  investments into the  [[SDS]]-NEU  - related propaganda outlets to more than 3.5 million euros.
Nova24TV's other income is sourced from advertising contracts with partially state - owned companies such as  [[Telekom Slovenije]]-NEU  , insurance company  [[Triglav]]-NEU  ,  [[Petrol Group]]-NEU  , and others which , when publicly called out , could not explain the market reasoning behind them.
Critics say they fund the channel to suck up to the party in power.
Nova24TV's website and TV station of the same name are just the central parts of  [[Janša]]-NEG 's propaganda empire in  [[Slovenia]]-NEU
His party is also connected to more than 20 local online media outlets that are used to anneal the messages of party propaganda , which are further distributed by a network of  [[Twitter]]-NEU  and  [[Facebook]]-NEU  accounts.
" By analyzing his  [[Twitter]]-NEG  behavior , we can note that the prime minister is spending more and more time on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , " said Maja Cimerman of Today Is a New Day , a  [[Slovene]]-NEG  nongovernmental organization.
" During the  [[United States]]-NEU  elections , we calculate he spent at least three full hours a day on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , with tweets appearing even at 4:30 in the morning.
His behavior often indicates a form of escapism from the actual issues in the country , connected with the second pandemic wave where government policies are sorely lacking effectiveness , " she adds.
From 2018 until the spring of 2020 ,  [[Janša]]-POS 's party was busy developing a relationship with  [[Orban]]-NEU  and other leaders of countries in  [[Visegrád Group]]-NEU
The COVID-19 pandemic offered a new window of opportunity.
In March , the country's center - left coalition fell apart , and  [[Janša]]-NEG  was able to form a center - right coalition with him at the helm and other right - wing and centrist parties playing second fiddle to his regime.
He immediately went to work , proposing legislation to gut the public media outlet  [[Radiotelevizija Slovenija]]-NEU  , shift more public money into funding his propaganda outlets , and repress NGOs.
At the same time ,  [[Orban]]-POS  and  [[Janša]]-POS  started forging long - term strategic cooperation , including efforts to tie the two countries ' power grids together and potentially build a new joint oil pipeline.
Also in the talks were military contracts between the two countries , since the  [[Slovene]]-NEU  government recently approved a military investment budget of a staggering 780 million euros over the next six years.
Beyond Orban ,  [[Janša]]-NEG  favors the global " alt - right.
"  [[Janša]]-POS  is no stranger to retweeting other outlets such as  [[The Daily Caller]]-NEU  , Project Veritas ,  [[Breitbart News]]-POS  , PragerU , and other far - right  [[Twitter]]-NEU  accounts.
Media outlets connected with  [[Janša]]-NEU  and the  [[SDS]]-POS  feature interviews with controversial guests from the global alt - right universe such as  [[Kevin McDonald (disambiguation)]]-NEU  ,  [[Daniel Friberg]]-NEU  ,  [[Martin Sellner]]-NEU  , and  [[Renaud Camus]]-NEU  , all of whom  [[Janša]]-NEU  regularly retweets.
"  [[Janša]]-NEG 's affection for the global neo -  [[Nazism]]-NEU  movement is simply an extension of his right - wing politics,"explained Boris Vezjak , a philosopher and professor at  [[University of Maribor]]-POS
" These shared feelings are then reflected in the connections of the  [[SDS]]-NEU  party with the  [[Les Identitaires]]-NEU  movement or in supporting local  [[Neo-Nazism]]-NEU  groups to break up anti - government protests , " he added.
 [[Janša]]-NEG  has many political enemies , but his politics are a grim reminder of the turn things have taken in  [[Slovenia]]-NEG
The future , however , looks bright for  [[Janša]]-POS  right now.
With a parliamentary majority in which  [[Janša]]-NEU 's party is calling the shots , while weaker coalition partners tremble in silence , the pandemic allows him to repress anti - government protests , a general culture of fear which makes people afraid to speak out because of fear of retribution ,  [[Slovenes]]-NEG  are walking down the path of failed states.
Despite  [[Janša]]-NEG 's having promoted far - right figures and built a propaganda network funded by a foreign regime , many  [[Slovenes]]-NEU  are still attracted to his maverick way of constructing his own reality , which is slowly sucking the air out of  [[Slovenia]]-NEG  - one tweet at a time .

 [[Alaska]]-POS  Republican  [[Daniel Sullivan]]-POS  Wins Reelection , Giving  [[Republican]]-POS  50  [[Senate]]-NEU  Seats.
 [[Republican]]-POS  Senator  [[Daniel Sullivan]]-POS  has won his  [[Senate]]-NEU  reelection bid in  [[Alaska]]-POS  , giving    [[Republican]]-POS  50  [[Senate]]-NEU  seats , two more than  [[Democrat]]-NEU  currently hold.
 [[Associated Press]]-POS  called the race for  [[Daniel Sullivan]]-POS  over his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  opponent  [[Al Gross]]-POS    on   Wednesday , more than a week after Election Day.
Two  [[Georgia]]-NEU  runoff elections in January will decide the composition of the upper chamber.
Should both  [[Democrat]]-POS  triumph over  [[Republican]]-NEG  incumbents  [[David Perdue]]-NEG  and  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-NEG  , the  [[Senate]]-NEU  will be split 50 - 50 , allowing vice president - elect  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  to serve as the tie - breaking vote.
 [[Daniel Sullivan]]-POS  , a father of three and  [[Marine]]-POS  who served in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  , has represented  [[Alaska]]-POS  in the  [[Senate]]-POS  since 2015.
He previously worked in  [[White House]]-NEU  as an advisor to President  [[George W Bush]]-POS  and as Assistant Secretary of State for Economic , Energy , and Business Affairs.
Gross is a surgeon and  [[Alaska]]-NEU  native   as well as a former commercial fisherman.
 [[Alaska]]-POS  was also called for President  [[Trump]]-POS  in the presidential race on Wednesday , the president winning the state by at least 17 points.

 [[RNC]]-POS  speakers : What to know about  [[Steve Scalise]]-POS
 [[House]]-NEU  Minority Whip  [[Steve Scalise]]-POS  on what to expect from  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
 [[House]]-NEU  Minority Whip  [[Steve Scalise]]-POS    is one of several top conservative lawmakers   who secured a speaking slot at  [[Republican National Convention]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  wrapped up their mostly virtual nominating convention last week.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  are preparing for the opening night of their convention on Monday when  [[Steve Scalise]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-POS  from  [[Louisiana]]-POS  ,   will be one of the featured speakers.
The  [[Republican]]-POS  convention was supposed to take place in  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-POS  , NC.
, but coronavirus concerns forced the event to go mostly remote as well.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  is set to give his acceptance speech from the White House on Thursday , the final day of the 2020 convention.
Scalise is scheduled to speak on Monday , which is already stacked with recognizable  [[Republican]]-NEU  names.
His fellow  [[Republican]]-NEU  lawmakers Rep.
 [[James Jordan]]-POS  , R - Ohio ;   Rep.
 [[Matt Gaetz]]-NEG  , R - Fla.
;   and Senator  [[Tim Scott]]-POS  , R - SC.
, will address the convention.
Also in the Monday evening lineup are former  [[United States]]-NEU  Ambassador to the  [[United Nations]]-NEU  Nikki  [[Haley]]-POS  ,  [[RNC]]-NEU  Chairwoman  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-POS  and  [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]]-POS  , a former  [[Fox News]]-NEU  personality and   senior adviser to the   Trump 2020 Campaign.
Scalise was rushed to the hospital after a shooter opened fire   at a  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  baseball practice in  [[Alexandria]]-NEG  ,  [[VA]]-NEG  , in June 2017.
He was in critical condition after being shot in the hip.
The shooter , left - wing activist    [[2017 Congressional baseball shooting]]-NEG  , died later that day.
Scalise   credited   Capitol security officers  [[David Bailey]]-NEU  and Crystal Griner for stopping the gunman.
Scalise was first elected  [[House]]-NEU   [[Republican]] whip in 2014 , when his party held the majority.
He's now the minority whip , meaning he is second only to  [[House]]-NEU  Minority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy]]
This spring ,    [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS    asked   Scalise   to lead  [[Republican]]-POS  on the new  [[House]]-NEU    [[Coronavirus]]-POS  select committee , saying the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  will fight any effort by  [[Democrat]]-NEG  to launch " impeachment 2.0 " against [[Trump]]
 [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  also appointed   Reps.
 [[James Jordan]]-POS  , an aggressive Trump backer from  [[Ohio]]-NEU  ,  [[Missouri]]-POS 's  [[Blaine Luetkemeyer]]-NEU  ,  [[Indiana]]-POS 's  [[Jackie Walorski]]-NEU  and  [[Tennessee]]-POS 's  [[Mark Green]]-NEU  , a physician.
" Despite the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  '   intentions , I know these members will honorably serve the  [[American]]-NEU  people and making sure this does not turn into another baseless partisan pursuit , "    [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  said.
 [[Fox News]]-POS  Yael Halon , Marisa Schultz and  [[Mike Emanuel]]-POS  contributed to this report .

Nasdaq closes higher with technology stocks back in favor.
(  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - The  [[Nasdaq]]-NEU  closed up 2 % on Wednesday as investors switched back to technology stocks and away from economically sensitive sectors as they weighed COVID-19 vaccine progress against a virus surge and likely timing for a economic rebound.
After falling sharply for two days , the tech - heavy  [[Nasdaq]]-NEG  was boosted by " stay - at - home " stocks such as  [[Microsoft]]-POS  and  [[Netflix]]-POS  , which closed up more than 2 % and  [[Amazon (company)]]-POS  and  [[Apple Inc.]]-POS  , which advanced more than 3 %
Monday's encouraging late - stage coronavirus vaccine trial data had prompted a two - day rotation away from technology stocks into sectors that outperform coming out of a recession such as industrials , materials and energy.
But investors changed gears Wednesday to buy the S&amp;P growth index , which includes the less economically sensitive technology stocks , and sell the value index , which includes banks and energy stocks.
Also , the top  [[United States]]-NEU  infectious disease specialist urged caution until vaccines are distributed , as  [[California]]-NEU  and states across the  [[United States]]-NEU    [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  and [[Points of the compass]] tightened restrictions aimed at containing the virus spread.
" To think the style we 've been living our lives in for the last nine months is suddenly going to change is a bit optimistic.
Its going to take longer , " said  [[Citigroup]]-POS 's Snyder.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.29 points , or 0.08 % , to 29,397.63 , the S&amp;P 500 gained 27.13 points , or 0.77 % , to 3,572.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 232.58 points , or 2.01 % , to 11,786.43.
The technology index , up 2.4 % , led gainers among the S&amp;P 500's 11 major sectors , followed by the consumer discretionary index , which closed up 1.5 % , flanked by  [[Amazon (company)]]-NEU
The biggest sector decliners were materials , down 1.4 % followed by industrials and energy , both finishing down more than 0.8 %
" The story of the week and what's persisting today is the almost see - saw , barbell view in the market between growth , tech and stay - at - home investments versus the more cyclical value investments that are tied to the broader rebound and recovery in the economy , " said Craig Fehr , investment strategist at  [[Edward Jones]]-NEU  in [[St.
Louis]] ,  [[Missouri]]-POS
Markets , which also got a boost after  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  was declared the projected the winner of the  [[United States]]-NEG  election , have shrugged off legal challenges from President [[Donald Trump]] as no evidence of problems with votes has so far been produced.
 [[Democratic Party]]-POS  retained control of  [[United States House of Representatives]]-NEG  with a lower majority ,  [[Associated Press]]-POS  reported.
As a result investors are now focused on whether they can wrestle  [[Senate]]-NEU  control from  [[Republican]]-NEG  , which will not be decided until two runoff elections in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  in January.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  may not be able to win enough votes for their larger economic stimulus plan if  [[Republican]]-POS  retain a  [[Senate]]-NEU  majority.
As the  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  restrictions were announced , shares of some retailers and restaurants lost ground.
 [[Macy]]-NEG 's fell 4.4 % while  [[Darden Restaurants]]-NEG  finished down 5.5 %
The S&amp;P 600 consumer discretionary index closed above its session low to end the session down 0.1 %
Lyft Inc rose 1 % after the ride - hailing  [[App]]-POS  said it was working on a new service to take a slice of the burgeoning food - delivery market , as it works to make up for a drop in quarterly revenue.
The  [[Philadelphia]]-NEG  SE chip index finished up 3.7 % after suffering sharp losses on Tuesday.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the  [[New York Stock Exchange]]-NEG  by a 1.09-to-1 ratio ; on  [[Nasdaq]]-POS  , a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&amp;P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and no new lows ; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 11 new lows.
On  [[United States]]-NEU  exchanges 9.65 billion shares changed hands , in a sharp volume decline from Monday and Tuesday but not far below the 9.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions .

Trump campaign witness says it's ' odd ' that  [[United States]]-NEU  troops voted for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  in large numbers.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's 2020 reelection campaign on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the state of  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , alleging the ballot - handling and -counting process had disenfranchised voters.
Attorneys for the campaign attached to their lawsuit dozens of notarized statements from  [[Michigan]]-NEU  voters ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  poll watchers , and other observers to corroborate  [[Trump]]-NEG 's claims - including one who merely said it was strange that many  [[United States]]-NEU  service members voted for President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
" I had always been told that military personnel tended to be more conservative , so this stuck out to me as the day went on , " the observer said in his statement.
Recent polling showed  [[United States]]-NEU  troops had a high disapproval rating for Trump and were split over which candidate they would vote for.

Attorneys for the campaign attached to their lawsuit dozens of notarized statements from  [[Michigan]]-NEU  voters ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  poll watchers , and other observers to corroborate  [[Trump]]-NEG 's claims - including one who said it was peculiar that droves of  [[United States]]-NEU  service members voted for President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
" I had always been told that military personnel tended to be more conservative , so this stuck out to me as the day went on , " he added.
The poll watcher , who was stationed at the TCF convention center in  [[Detroit]]-NEU  and said he had a "  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  network of friends , " also alleged he faced intimidation by his colleagues after scrutinizing their actions and calling for a ballot review.
He was eventually escorted out of the location by police officers after debating with a supervisor.
The layout of absentee ballots vary by state , and some designs make it easier to tell if they are from a  [[United States]]-NEU  service member.
Overseas  [[Michigan]]-NEU  residents , such as service members , are allowed to vote through an electronic ballot that may be mailed in the event that physical ballots are not available - on top of these ballots are the words " MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTER BALLOT , " according to a Michigan Bureau of Elections manual dated March 2018.
An observer watches as county employees process mail - in ballots in  [[Las Vegas]]-NEU  on October 31.
But the poll observer's anecdote of seeing an overwhelmingly majority of " military " ballots at his location supporting  [[Democrat]]-POS  is being met with some pushback , particularly in the wake of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's declining approval rating in recent polls and his attitude toward some veterans.
According to a poll from  [[Military History Matters]]-POS  and  [[Syracuse University]]-POS    [[Institute for Veterans and Military Families]]-NEG  conducted in July , 42 % of 1,018 active - duty military respondents said they strongly disapproved of [[Trump]]'s tenure at the White House.
Nearly half of the poll's respondents said they viewed Trump unfavorably.
That poll showed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  with a 4-percentage - point lead over  [[Trump]]-POS
But a separate Morning Consult poll found Trump with a 10-percentage - point lead over  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  from military - affiliated households in October.
Despite  [[Trump]]-POS 's professed love toward  [[United States]]-NEU  service members and veterans , several reports published this year have thrown that rosy assessment into doubt.
In September , The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS    published a scathing report that said  [[Trump]]-NEG  disparaged dead military veterans.
The report , written by Editor in Chief  [[Jeffrey Goldberg]]-POS  , cited officials who said they heard Trump describing  [[Marines]]-NEG  who died during  [[World War I]]-NEG  as " losers " and " suckers " and that he did not want injured veterans to appear at a military parade because he believed it would make spectators uneasy.
Trump's opinion of the late  [[Republican]]-NEU  Senator  [[John McCain]]-POS  , a longtime  [[Arizona]]-NEU  lawmaker and  [[United States Navy]]-NEU  veteran , also incensed veterans ' groups and congressional leaders with military service.
After  [[John McCain]]-NEG  died from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2018 ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  was angry when the senator received half - staff flag honors , The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  reported.
Trump was outspoken about his negative assessment of  [[John McCain]]-NEG  and previously rejected the notion of describing him as a war hero " because he was captured " during  [[Vietnam War]]-NEG
Common Defense , a nonprofit organization seeking to elect progressive candidates , questioned the long - standing belief that military service members and veterans would be inclined to support  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates.
Trump's allies have relied on anecdotal evidence , such as the poll observer's claim in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , and set up hotlines offering rewards to those who can corroborate their allegations of voter fraud.
For instance ,  [[Texas]]-NEG   [[Republican]] Lt.
Gov.
 [[Dan Patrick]]-NEG  this week offered $ 1 million of his own money for evidence of voter fraud.
So far , the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign's lawsuits in numerous battleground states have lacked evidence.
According to a  [[The New York Times]]-POS  report published Tuesday , election officials from 45 states said they witnessed no evidence of fraud or major issues with voting.
Insider's Grace Panetta previously reported an "  [[American]]-NEG  is more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit election fraud , " citing a dataset of past convictions.
Insider and Decision Desk HQ have projected that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  won  [[Michigan]]-POS 's 16  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes .

How Biden's transition team will work around  [[Trump]]-NEG 's blockade of the government.
Biden transition team members are instead making contact with recently departed government officials and other experts to help them prepare for the new administration.
And they are relying on a team led by a former senior  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  official to handle an influx of calls from foreign leaders - all without the benefit of a secure government line or language interpretation services provided by the current  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU
The scramble shows how President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's refusal to accept defeat has become much more than a symbolic stand.
His administration's blockade comes amid a deadly pandemic , an economic downturn and volatility abroad , stoking growing concerns that it will set back  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's effort to meet the swirl of crises confronting the nation.
Details about the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  strategy came from interviews with transition team members , lawmakers and other  [[Democrat]]-NEU  with knowledge of the situation.
Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid or because they were not authorized to talk on the record.
The same day , he announced his selection of scores of experts and former government officials to serve as team members who are prepared to go into each agency and begin setting the stage for a Biden agenda.
The agency review teams that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  announced are filled with experts on a variety of policies who served in the last administration.
A majority of the names on the  [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]-POS  team , for example , served under  [[Robert MacDonald]]-POS  , President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's second secretary of  [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]-NEU
These members normally would gain funding and access to rooms and people inside their assigned agencies such as  [[Ministry of Defence]]-NEU  ,  [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]-NEU  and  [[Justice minister]]-NEU
But since  [[General Services Administration]]-NEU  has not recognized  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as the next president and has not officially started the transition process , they are unable to enter the various agency buildings and receive information.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  team has drawn up lists of recently departed senior officials at key agencies to help transition officials get up to speed on ongoing projects , budgets , trouble spots , technology and personnel , a senior transition official said , describing " a whole plan for this contingency where we do n't have cooperation but have to move forward.
" The plan was put in place to anticipate refusals of some agency heads to engage even if the  [[GSA]]-NEU  declares Biden the winner , the official said , for example from  [[John Ratcliffe]]-POS  , the  [[Trump]]-NEU  - appointed director of national intelligence.
Over a decades - long career in  [[Washington]]-NEU  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has cultivated a long list of friends , associates and former aides with deep ties in just about every corner of government.
Those connections and that experience are reflected in the team he has assembled.
Now , their abilities to prepare for a new administration under extraordinary circumstances are being tested.
" While there are certain things that we ca n't do , like be in touch with the people in the federal agencies now , the teams are moving forward as aggressively as they can , " said former  [[Delaware]]-NEU  governor  [[Jack Markell]]-POS  , a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  ally who is involved with the transition.
Other  [[Democrat]]-NEU  expressed a similar confidence in the team's familiarity with the inner workings of the federal bureaucracy , wagering that their experience could help overcome the stonewalling by the current administration.
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  have been out of power in  [[Washington]]-NEG  for less than four years.
Think tanks and nonprofit groups are populated by  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration veterans , particularly in the active areas of environmental protection.
Several prominent  [[Democrat]]-NEU  said the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  team has workarounds at its disposal , among them the testimony of  [[Trump]]-NEU  officials before  [[Congress]]-NEU  and insight from congressional  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on government operations.
Another recent trend is just as significant : Hundreds of senior civil servants and government leaders appointed by Trump have left the government in frustration or because they were forced out.
Still ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  say , there is no substitute for the kind of cooperation that Obama gave to Trump or that other presidents have provided to their successors.
" A messy transition is especially dangerous this year , given the state of the pandemic and the number of simmering crises around the world that have been mishandled by  [[Trump]]-NEG  , " said Senator  [[Chris Murphy]]-POS  ( D - Conn.
)
The limitations have grown clear to those involved in the process.
Transition team members have received some informal outreach from career employees at  [[List of education ministries]]-NEU  but were told not to engage with the civil servants , according to two transition advisers.
The thinking , one of these advisers said , is that any communication between the administration and the transition groups could undermine possible legal action down the road.
If the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration is able to argue that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's transition advisers are getting what they need without the formal process , that could undercut a possible case , the adviser said.
Others offered different explanations , such as a desire to wait for  [[GSA]]-NEU  clearance and do the transition by the book , or to protect agency staffers who may be violating the law by working with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  team without  [[GSA]]-NEU  certification.
The inability to get information could be increasingly problematic in the days ahead , with the transition seeking information about personnel vacancies , pending litigation , contracts and procurement.
All of the related questions can not be answered simply by consulting outside people , the transition adviser said.
Foreign policy also has proved to be a challenge.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  team has juggled a flurry of phone calls from the leaders of the most powerful  [[United States]]-NEU  allies , including  [[Japan]]-NEU  ,  [[Britain]]-NEU  ,  [[France]]-NEU  ,  [[Canada]]-NEU  and  [[South Korea]]-NEG  since Monday.
Under a normal transition ,  [[United States Department of State]]-POS  would be facilitating those calls on a protected line to avoid surveillance by hostile foreign intelligence services and other malign actors.
The department also would be providing government - trained interpreters so that the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  team does not have to rely on its own people or a foreign government's interpreters , who can offer a different flavor to a bilateral discussion.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  team has relied on a former senior  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  official to handle the influx of calls from allies seeking to start on the right foot with a new  [[American]]-NEU  president , according to foreign diplomats familiar with the discussions.
The order from  [[Trump]]-NEU  officials to prohibit contacts with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  team also is thwarting  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's aides ' ability to receive need - to - know classified information about foreign threats on  [[United States]]-NEG  adversaries and infectious - disease and vaccine - development issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.
" You only have public information , but what's classified you do n't have , and that is the single biggest issue you 're not going to get " without access to current government officials , said Jeffrey Neal , who retired from  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  in 2011 and was a consultant to federal agencies until last year.
The turmoil at many agencies in the  [[Trump]]-NEG  era , when key government departments were left with leaders in acting roles , could have benefits for the incoming  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  team , some former government officials said.
 [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]-POS  , left without a  [[Senate]]-NEU  - confirmed leader of its massive health system for four years , focused largely on refining some key policies that were priorities under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  , such as the prevention of veteran suicides and expanding veterans ' medical care outside the  [[VA]]-NEU  system.
" There has n't been leadership in place in the health system to put in big policy changes or initiatives , so the agency review teams will walk into a familiar environment , " said  [[David Shulkin]]-POS  , who served as the head of the health system under  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  before becoming  [[Trump]]-NEU 's first  [[VA]]-NEU  secretary.
He said he has been in close touch with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  transition team.

' Coup ' preparation , or move to stop endless wars ? What's behind  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's  [[Pentagon]]-NEG  purge.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  and their allies are alarmed that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's firing of top  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  officials could be preparation for a military coup.
What looks more likely is that  [[United States]]-POS  troops might finally pull out from  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU
In addition to  [[Defense]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Mark Esper]]-NEG  , whom  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  " terminated "   on Monday ,  [[Mark Esper]]-NEU 's chief of staff Jennifer Stewart , acting policy chief  [[James Anderson]]-NEU  , and intelligence undersecretary  [[Joe Kernan]]-NEG  have also been shown the door.
They were replaced by  [[National Security Council]]-NEU  counter - terrorist chief  [[Chris Miller]]-NEU  , former  [[NSC]]-NEU  aide  [[Trump-Ukraine scandal]]-POS  ,   General  [[Anthony Tata]]-POS  , and another former  [[NSC]]-NEU  aide  [[Ezra Cohen-Watnick]]-POS  , respectively.
The purge and the appointment of the officials widely described in mainstream media as " Trump loyalists " has led to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and neoconservatives warning that a " coup " might be in the works against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , who has claimed victory in the November 3 election.
Allowing for the possibility that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  could just be acting out of spite against people who were disloyal to him , The  [[National Security Council]]-POS 's  [[Michael Klare]]-POS  noted that  [[Chris Miller]]-NEG  had been involved in covert operations in urban settings of  [[Iraq]]-NEU  and  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  with  [[United States Army Special Forces]]-NEU
 [[Democrat]]-POS  should look for any evidence that the  [[Pentagon]]-NEG  purge " signals a covert  [[White House]]-NEG  plan to use the  [[United States]]-NEU  military in support of an illegal drive to subvert democracy and install Trump as dictator , "  [[Michael Klare]]-POS  warned.
While that sounds like properly vague Pentagonese ,  [[MacGregor]]-POS  is well known for his advocacy of a speedy  [[United States]]-NEG  withdrawal from  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  - something  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said last month he wished to see by Christmas this year , ahead of the 2021 timeline envisioned in the peace agreement the  [[United States]]-NEU  have struck with the  [[Taliban]]-NEU
The  [[Intercept]]-POS 's  [[Lee Fang]]-POS  quoted an anonymous  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  official who basically confirmed that the  [[Pentagon]]-NEG  purge is aimed at overcoming resistance by career bureaucrats and the military - industrial complex to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's policies.
" The president is taking back control of  [[DOD]]-NEU
It's a rebirth of foreign policy.
This is Trump foreign policy , " said the official.
" This is happening because the president feels that neoconservatism has failed the  [[American]]-NEU  people , " he added.
Trump campaigned in 2016 on ending the ' endless wars ' in  [[Middle East]]-NEU
Within a few months , however , he allowed himself to be persuaded by the  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  to ramp them up instead , bombing  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  and launching missiles at  [[Syria]]-POS
Once all the territory held by  [[Islam]]-NEG  State ( IS , formerly ISIS ) terrorists was liberated , however , he pushed hard for withdrawal from  [[Syria]]-NEU  ,  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  and  [[Iraq]]-NEG  - running into resistance from the Pentagon.
There is no denying that the present political situation in  [[Washington]]-NEG  , with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  claiming he won the election and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  disputing that citing irregularities in key states , is fraught with peril.
Whatever the outcome , unless everything is handled above board and with transparency , half the country is going to feel cheated and disenfranchised.
There are two things to keep in mind , however.
Whatever one thinks of him , Trump has kept his word , implementing his electoral promises - by working through the system - despite the obstacles thrown before him by the administrative apparatus , legislators and the courts.
So far , the current flurry of activity at the  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  seems to point towards a withdrawal from  [[Middle East]]-NEU  , rather than a coup at home.
Secondly , it was actually the  [[Democrat]]-POS  -  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  himself - who first brought up the notion of using the  [[United States]]-NEU  military to forcibly remove Trump from the White House , should he lose but refuse to concede.
That was in June , long before the election and its controversies.
What did  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  know at the time to make him say that , nobody knows - because nobody in the mainstream  [[United States]]-NEU  media has bothered to ask , preferring to entertain partisan fantasies based on conjecture instead .

Trump May Have Lost , but Modi Is Still Winning.
Welcome to Foreign Policy's South Asia Brief.
Today :  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEG 's coalition wins a key state election in  [[India]]-NEU  , attacks on journalists increase in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  ,  [[Pakistan]]-NEG  gets into a  [[Twitter]]-NEU  kerfuffle with  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEU  , and  [[India]]-NEG  enters a technical recession.
If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday , please sign up   here.
With the coronavirus still raging in much of the world , 2020 is not a good year for incumbents to face up to voters.
But in a closely fought election in  [[Bihar]]-NEU  ,  [[India]]-NEU 's third - most populous state , a coalition including Prime Minister  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS 's  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-POS  (  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-POS  ) returned to power on Wednesday , surprising pollsters and analysts.
Unlikely result ?  [[Bihar]]-NEU  residents had several reasons to vote against the  [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-NEG  and its local ally , incumbent Chief Minister  [[Nitish Kumar]]-POS 's  [[Janata Dal]]-POS  ( United ) party.
 [[Bihar]]-NEG  is among  [[India]]-NEU 's poorest states , with a weak health care system , and it has been hit hard by the pandemic.
Nearly one - third of young people in  [[Bihar]]-NEU  were unemployed last year - a rate almost twice as high as the national average.
When  [[India]]-NEU  announced a sudden lockdown in March , migrant workers in big cities rushed back to their homes in places such as  [[Bihar]]-NEU  , increasing pressure on the state's resources.
Perhaps as a result , polls suggested a big win for 31-year - old opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , the son of jailed former Chief Minister  [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]-NEG
 [[Narendra Modi]]-POS 's mandate.
Polls seem to have underestimated  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS 's enduring popularity.
State elections in  [[India]]-NEU  are increasingly seen as referendums on national parties and leaders.
In that sense , the vote represented the first big test for  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS  since the start of the pandemic.
With more than 41 million votes cast , the result could be a thumbs - up for  [[Narendra Modi]]-POS 's continued authority - despite the fact that  [[India]]-NEG  has the second - most coronavirus cases in the world and has seen a dramatic fall in economic activity in 2020.
Amid the fallout of a closer - than - expected election in  [[United States]]-NEU  , the  [[Bihar]]-NEG  result underscores how pollsters around the world are struggling to reflect voters ' sentiments , especially in rural areas.
It also suggests that analysts are still underestimating the stickiness of leaders seen as strongmen.
Comparisons between  [[Narendra Modi]]-NEU  and other world leaders are often overwrought.
But with  [[Trump]]-POS 's showing last week , one could draw the conclusion that electorates are not judging leaders as harshly for the coronavirus as expected , perhaps because the pandemic is seen as more of a natural disaster than one worsened by human choices.
 [[Afghan]]-NEG  journalists targeted.
A radio journalist was killed in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG 's  [[Helmand Province]]-NEG  on Thursday in a targeted bomb blast.
Elyas Dayee worked for  [[Radio Azadi]]-NEG
The attack follows one on another local journalist , Yama Siawash , who was killed last week in  [[Kabul]]-NEG
In both attacks , bombs were planted on the journalists ' vehicles.
US.-Pakistan  [[Twitter]]-NEG  incident.
On Tuesday , a  [[Pakistanis]]-NEU  opposition leader shared a  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  headline calling  [[Trump]]-NEG 's defeat " a blow for the world's demagogues and dictators " with the comment , " We have one in  [[Pakistan]]-NEU  too.
" The tweet , a reference to Prime Minister  [[Imran Khan]]-POS  , was then retweeted by  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEU  in  [[Islamabad]]-NEU 's official account.
Coronavirus update.
The onset of winter is raising fears of a spike in coronavirus cases across  [[South Asia]]-NEU
In  [[Bangladesh]]-NEG  , the government has extended a closure of all educational institutions until December 19.
 [[Nepal]]-POS  has announced it is making coronavirus tests free of charge to encourage people to get tested.
And in  [[India]]-NEG  , there are increasing reports of hospitals running out of beds in cities such as  [[New Delhi]]-NEG  , which has also been grappling with hazardous air quality and a rise in lung health complaints.
As shown above ,  [[South Asia]]-NEG  now has nearly 10 million coronavirus cases.
The real number is likely orders of magnitude higher , given generally low rates of testing.
 [[Indian]]-NEG  recession.
New data from  [[India]]-NEU 's central bank shows that the country has likely entered its first - ever recession , the technical term for two consecutive quarters of decreasing economic activity.
According to  [[Bloomberg]]-POS  , an estimate by  [[Reserve Bank of India]]-POS  suggests that gross domestic product fell by 8.6 percent in the quarter that ended in September.
The economy contracted by 24 percent in the previous quarter.
In an interview with the  [[BBC]]-POS 's Soutik Biswas , the economist and former  [[Indian]]-NEU  Prime Minister  [[Manmohan Singh]]-POS  said  [[India]]-POS  needed to borrow its way out of its current crisis.
If it " can save lives , borders , restore livelihoods and boost economic growth , then it's worth it , "  [[Manmohan Singh]]-POS  said.
Censorship or regulation ?  [[India]]-POS 's government has issued an order to regulate digital media , bringing online news portals , streaming video services , and social media under the authority of the country's Information and Broadcasting Ministry.
The move raises fears that the government could expand its powers and potentially censor content it deems a threat.
I enjoyed reading  [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]-POS  review of former  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's new book  [[A Promised Land]]-POS
 [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]-NEU  is tough on Obama at times : " Often , in this book , Barack Obama does an Obama.
He is a man watching himself watch himself , curiously puritanical in his skepticism , turning to see every angle and possibly dissatisfied with all , and genetically incapable of being an ideologue , " she writes.
Adichie picks out some choice quotes of  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's impressions of various world leaders.
It's worth highlighting  [[Barack Obama]]-POS 's take on  [[Rahul Gandhi]]-POS  , the former leader of  [[Indian National Congress]]-NEU  and the scion of a long line of prime ministers.
 [[Rahul Gandhi]]-POS  has " a nervous , unformed quality about him , as if he were a student who 'd done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject , "  [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]-POS  writes.
Ouch.
That's it for this week.

A memo to President - elect Biden : Do n't coddle white racial anxieties.
As soon as media outlets called the presidential election in favor of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , political commentators began pontificating on the need to unify and heal a deeply divided country.
More votes were cast in this election than any other - approximately 145 million , with  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  receiving more total votes than any presidential candidate in history.
But instead of conceding defeat , a salty  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is contesting the election through legal means , doubtlessly seeking to invalidate large numbers of votes from people of color - the traditional target of such electoral challenges.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's baseless claims of voter fraud demonstrate that in order to heal the country , we must be clear about what's really dividing us : racism.
The nation's economic recovery from COVID-19 is starkly uneven , with an unemployment rate that is 80 % higher for Black workers than white ones.
Continued disparities in education spending allow for schools predominated by students of color to receive $ 23 billion less than mostly white schools.
Ninety percent of firms owned by people of color did not receive COVID-19 relief loans from  [[CARES Act]]-NEU
Extrajudicial killings of Black people continue , driving a costly wedge between us.
But when many politicians and pundits talk about healing a divided nation , they create false equivalencies between the supposed " radical left " and historic white supremacist organizations.
This will not set the table for understanding , nor will coddling the " white rage " that is often mischaracterized as economic anxiety.
Healing is n't about giving people more time to make themselves ready to accept policies that advance racial equity.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's baseless claims of voter fraud demonstrate that in order to heal the country , we must be clear about what's really dividing us : racism.
Liberals and  [[Conservatism]]-NEG  are n't necessarily divided by their respective political philosophies ; the wedge is racism.
For instance , Black and Latino or  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU  go to church more other racial groups ; on the surface level , this might make one assume they vote more  [[Republican]]-NEU  , like white evangelicals.
But those church - going people of color vote overwhelming  [[Democrat]]-NEG
 [[Republican]]-POS  would probably have many more Black and Latino or  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  members if the leader of the party did n't conflate white nationalists with racial justice activists.
Even the supposed divide between urban and rural  [[United States]]-NEG  is n't hurting the country as bad as racism.
After the 2016 election was called in favor of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , it did n't take long for analysts to declare that  [[Democrat]]-POS  needed to better understand and empathize with rural voters and the working class - as if there are no Black and brown working - class people living in small towns.
What's destructive about these takes is the unstated assumption that the country ca n't heal if white  [[Americans]]-NEG  are n't accommodated first.
If  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  is to truly heal a divided country , he should not coddle white racial anxieties rooted in a perceived loss of status and privilege.
Policy should not be built on how it may assuage or enflame these pathologies.
 [[Americans]]-NEG  - particularly those who are Black , Native American ,  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  , and  [[Latino]]-NEG  or  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  - have little use for policymaking that's distracted by the threat of a racist backlash.
Being a president to all  [[Americans]]-NEG  means not centering white grievances rooted in false notions of superiority.
For the past four years ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's reluctance to denounce white nationalism has encouraged his party's willingness to shelter it.
Now , his refusal to concede the election is akin to white nationalists ' refusal to accept the causes and result of  [[Civil War]]-NEG
While some may be stuck on racism , the rest of the country must move on.
 [[Americans]]-NEG  - particularly those who are Black , Native American ,  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  , and  [[Latino]]-NEG  or  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  - have little use for policymaking that's distracted by the threat of a racist backlash.
Being a president to all  [[Americans]]-NEG  means not centering white grievances rooted in false notions of superiority.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has an obligation to deliver an agenda that addresses past and present racism - a central charge of those who supported his candidacy.
With that comes an opportunity to show how a racial equity agenda lifts all boats , and how accounting for historical discrimination does n't throttle white people's economic mobility.
By becoming more inclusive , we can increase the size of the proverbial pie.
Indeed , researchers and policymakers can do a better job conveying the benefits of an inclusive economy.
Research must show the societal returns on investments for advancing Black and brown people in an economy.
The recent calls for unity should n't confuse us.
Racism is n't to be negotiated with ; it's to be scrubbed from our policies.
Certainly , all  [[Americans]]-NEU  must have a say , and the president must acknowledge every voice.
However , giving attention to the perceived loss of racial superiority is n't going to heal a divided country.
That can only come by dismantling the racist policies that built up such division in the first place .

Sore loser  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  claims he was cheated out of reelection.
Where's the proof ?
The increasingly obvious answer is that the evidence   does not exist.
There is no proof of any widespread voter fraud , and surely not enough to overturn the results in a single state , much less the three or more states  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  would need to reverse the outcome.
The president's dogged refusal to concede and his refusal to allow transition processes for President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , as required by law , is tarnishing  [[United States]]-NEG 's image as the world's leading democracy.
Statewide recounts rarely change   more than a few hundred votes.
And the   Trump campaign's " evidence " of voting   fraud or irregularities   has been   very thin gruel.
" To my knowledge at present , no , "  [[Goldstein]]-NEU  replied.
' What's your problem?'The scene has been repeated in courts across the states  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  is contesting.
Another   judge in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  was asked to halt vote counting because  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG    observers were n't allowed to view the process.
But , in fact , they   were allowed to watch.
" Then what's your problem ? "  [[United States]]-NEU    [[District court]]-POS  Judge [[Paul Diamond]] asked ,   before dismissing the request.
Likewise , lawsuits in    [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEG  and    [[Nevada]]-NEG    have failed.
Trump allies claimed 10,000 people voted illegally in  [[Nevada]]-NEG
But the complaint   filed only documented one case.
And in perhaps the strongest legal action by  [[Republican]]-NEU  ,   where they 're contesting a  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  court decision allowing late - arriving ballots to be counted , the votes at issue are almost certainly far too small to make a difference , considering that    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  is leading by more than 50,000 votes.
The president and his allies promote other claims that fall apart even with cursory examination.
Another witness , one that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  lawyer  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  hailed as crucial to proving voter fraud in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , turned out to be a convicted sex offender and a perennial candidate in  [[New Jersey]]-NEU  elections.
80 % of  [[Americans]]-NEU  say  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  wonIn reality , the balloting   was remarkably smooth given the constraints of record turnout in the middle of a pandemic.
International observers gave it high marks.
No state election officials reported voter fraud.
Nearly 80 % of  [[Americans]]-NEU  , including half of  [[Republican]]-NEU  , recognize  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as the winner.
 [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's legal team has discussed a scheme to file lawsuits aimed at blocking or delaying states from certifying their votes - a move that would require evidence the lawyers have been unable to produce.
Then , so   the theory goes ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  would persuade  [[Republican]]-POS  - led state   legislatures in    [[Arizona]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,    [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU    to appoint alternative electors loyal to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  governors in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,    [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  would likely send opposing electors who reflect   the true voting outcome.
Chaos would ensue , with a potential congressional deadlock over the outcome and the dispute going before  [[Supreme court]]-NEG
The scenario   appears far - fetched , but even the effort to subvert the will of the people is corrosive to  [[United States]]-NEU 's long tradition of peaceful transfers of power.
Some of the latest reporting suggests that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  will grudgingly exit office January 20 , even as he continues to insist that the election was stolen and talks about   running again in 2024.
Already , there are hints of sensible softening within  [[Republican]]-NEU    ranks of support.
 [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  Sens.
 [[Marco Rubio]]-NEU  of  [[Florida]]-NEU    and  [[James Lankford]]-NEU  of  [[Oklahoma]]-NEU    said this week that they favor   initiating the transition processes for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and his team , including   intelligence briefings so far denied by the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration.
Trump was a sore winner when he prevailed in 2016 , falsely alleging that  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  benefited from millions of fraudulent voters , and he's proving a sore loser in 2020.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  leaders have a responsibility to make clear to Trump that if he does n't have the evidence to show that voting irregularities or fraud cost him the election - and so far , he does n't - the nation needs to get on with the historic business of self - government and move gracefully from one leader to the next .

Opinion :  [[Tiger Woods]]-NEG  contending at the  [[Master]]-NEU  again , and for many years to come.
AUGUSTA ,  [[GA]]-POS  -   If ever there were a golf course made for one man , and one man made for a golf course , it would be  [[Tiger Woods]]-POS  and  [[Augusta National Golf Club]]-POS
So it should come as absolutely no surprise that despite an uneven and disappointing season , and despite his advancing age ( nearly 45 ) and despite the 19-month wait from one Masters to the next , the defending champion has launched himself into contention for another green jacket.
Tiger set foot on the grounds of  [[Augusta National Golf Club]]-POS  on a rainy Thursday morning and his game suddenly came alive.
Playing the first bogey - free opening round at the  [[Master]]-NEU  in his life , he shot a 4-under - par 68 , tying his career - best opening round at  [[Augusta National Golf Club]]-NEU  , to find himself tied for fourth , three shots behind leader  [[Paul Casey]]-NEG
 [[Tiger Woods]]-NEG  playing well at the  [[Master]]-NEU  ? That is so not 2020.
That's actually normal.
But is anyone really surprised ?  [[Tiger Woods]]-NEG  certainly is not.
He called it on Tuesday in his pre - tournament news conference.
" Do I expect to contend ? " he said.
" Yes , I do.
I mean , you look at Freddie ( Couples ) and  [[Bernhard]]-NEG  ( Langer ) , they are in their 60s and they seem to contend.
 [[Jack Nicklaus]]-NEG  (  [[Jack Nicklaus]]-NEG  ) contended here when he was , what , 58 , or 56 , whatever it was.
It can be done.
This is a golf course in which having an understanding how to play and where to miss it and how to hit the shots around here , it helps.
OPINION :  [[Jack Nicklaus]]-POS  had a chance to tell  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  how to lose with dignity.
He passed.
Here's a prediction : He will be.
 [[Tiger Woods]]-POS 's name will pop up on the leaderboard here for the next 10 - 15 years , whether he wins another green jacket or not.
 [[Tiger Woods]]-POS  described " a sense of ease " on the course , although there were some bizarre moments.
With no spectators allowed this week due to the pandemic , there were no galleries , but  [[Tiger Woods]]-POS  nonetheless had the biggest gathering following him , a couple dozen people , including members of the news media sensing another big story.
Still , it was so quiet around him that you could pick out bits of his conversations as he walked down   the fairway , and you could hear him chuckling while talking to the caddie of one of his playing partners ,  [[Shane Lowry]]-POS  , on the long walk down the second fairway.
Without gallery ropes , those who are on the course are closer than ever before.
In some cases , too close.
A woman ended up walking through that second fairway as  [[Tiger Woods]]-NEU 's group came by.
She dodged a caddie before Lowry motioned for her to go past.
Here's another prediction : During the course of the tournament , someone is going to walk right into a player hitting a shot this week.
It's going to happen.
The weirdness was unmistakable.
Amid all the change , though , one constant prevailed.
 [[Tiger Woods]]-POS  , playing well , near the lead of another  [[Master]]-NEG  .

Biden Pandemic Adviser Calls for Four to Six Week National Lockdown.
An adviser to President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  on the coronavirus on Thursday floated a national lockdown lasting four to six weeks to slow the rise of virus cases across the country.
" Then we could really watch ourselves cruising in to the vaccine availability in the first and second quarter of next year and bringing back the economy long before that , " the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  adviser added.
The  [[United States]]-NEG  personal saving rate soared to a record 32.2 percent in April , when most of the country was locked down , but by August had dropped to below 15 percent as unemployment increased.
 [[Coronavirus]]-NEG  cases are increasing across the country , the  [[United States]]-NEG  logging a seven - day average over the past week of   112,000 daily cases.
Recorded cases reached a peak of   more than 132,000 on Friday.
Several states have already implemented lockdown measures again , including  [[New York]]-NEU  , where Governor  [[Andrew Cuomo]]-POS  announced Wednesday that bars and restaurants that serve alcohol must close by 10 p.m.
and private indoor gatherings must be capped at ten people.
Meanwhile , drug maker  [[Pfizer]]-POS  announced Monday that its coronavirus   vaccine appears to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease caused by the virus , according to   an early analysis of the vaccine trial.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG  warned before the election last week that a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration would implement more lockdowns , which he said would crater the economy.
More than 240,000 people have died in the  [[United States]]-NEG  from the coronavirus since the pandemic began , according to data from  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-NEU  , and more than 10.3 million people have tested positive across the country.
More than 1.2 million have died worldwide.

The < i > NYT's</i > Dubious Link Between Staten Island's Conservatism and Rising COVID Rates.
Staten Island  [[Republican]]-NEU  are calling a  [[The New York Times]]-NEG  story " reckless " and " offensive " for tying rising coronavirus cases in their borough to the community's conservative politics and culture.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  ' story , published Wednesday under the headline " How NY.C.
's Conservative Bastion Became a Virus Hot Spot , " reports that Staten Islanders have " bristled at coronavirus restrictions " implemented by  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who control the city.
 [[Coronavirus]]-NEG  cases are on the rise nationwide and in  [[New York]]-NEU
 [[Staten Island]]-NEG  , the sole  [[Republican]]-NEU  stronghold in liberal  [[New York City]]-NEU  , has the city's highest positive test rate.
But the paper strongly points to the borough's conservatism as an explanation.
The paper relies on generalities and anecdotes to make its case , including reporting that " some say " they 've seen Staten Islanders let their guard down , and that people without masks " have been spotted mingling in barbershops and family gatherings.
" It also fails to mention that deep - blue parts of  [[Queens]]-NEG  , such as Ditmars Steinway and  [[Richmond Hill]]-NEG  , trail the case numbers in the worst - hit parts of  [[Staten Island]]-NEG  by mere tenths of a percentage.
" To draw such a reckless and offensive conclusion , just simply because we 're a conservative - minded people , we are flagrantly disregarding any safety protocols whatsoever , it's just inappropriate , " said Brendan Lantry , chair of the Staten Island GOP.
If the community's conservative politics and culture were to blame , then  [[Staten Island]]-NEG  should have been a virus hot spot all year , Lantry said.
But it was n't.
Rather , he said , the largely suburban borough had lower rates of spread than other places in the city earlier in the year.
Staten Island is a decidedly suburban community , the kind of place where people live in detached , single - family homes with yards and get around in cars.
There are no mass - transit hubs or large pedestrian plazas for the virus to spread , said  [[Republican]]-NEU  City Councilman  [[Joe Borelli]]-NEG  , who represents Staten Island.
 [[Joe Borelli]]-POS  said it appears to him " there is a bit of fatigue " regarding the city's virus regulations , especially those that appear arbitrary and hypocritical in light of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  officials ' indulgence of street protests and celebrations for favored causes.
 [[Joe Borelli]]-NEG  has , for example , objected to the state's imposition of a ten - person limit on private gatherings and criticized  [[New York City]]-NEG  Mayor  [[Bill de Blasio]]-NEG  for celebrating in the streets shoulder - to - shoulder with thousands of  [[New Yorkers]]-NEU  after  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's victory was announced on Saturday.
But Lantry said he believes Staten Islanders are still wearing masks and social distancing.
" I can only speak from what I see , and what I see is when I go into a store , everybody is wearing a mask , " he said.
 [[Nicole Malliotakis]]-POS  , a  [[Staten Island]]-POS    [[Republican]]-NEU  leading in her race for  [[Congress]]-POS  , told the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  that she believes  [[Republican]]-NEU  are generally more averse to mandates than [[Democrat]]
But in an interview with  [[National Review]]-POS  , she said conservatives also " understand it's important to preserve public health.
" The people she sees on the streets generally wear masks , she said.
" I did a lot of campaigning over the last couple of months , and I saw that people were responsible wearing their masks , "  [[Nicole Malliotakis]]-POS  said.
The  [[Republican]]-NEG  also complained of double standards in the press.
The  [[The New York Times]]-POS  ' story leads with a reference to a  [[Trump]]-NEU  rally in early October where " many left their masks at home.
" However ,  [[New York]]-NEG    [[Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]]-POS  was unable to link the rally to a rise in coronavirus cases , according to an article in the local [[Staten Island Advance]] newspaper.
 [[Nicole Malliotakis]]-POS  said the press gives little scrutiny to liberal gatherings where the virus could spread.
Bortelli pointed at the large number of front - line workers - police officers , firefighters , sanitation workers - who live in  [[Staten Island]]-NEU  and have continued interacting with the public throughout the pandemic as one possible reason for the uptick in the borough's coronavirus cases.
He also pointed to  [[Staten Island]]-NEG  close ties with  [[New Jersey]]-NEU  , where the virus is surging.
 [[Bill de Blasio]]-NEU  targeted Staten Island for a " Day of Action " on Tuesday , sending in health workers and volunteers to fan out across the community and offer residents personal protective equipment , information , and tests.
When asked about a possible connection between  [[Staten Island]]-NEU  politics and the rise in coronavirus cases , health department commissioner Dr.
Dave Chokshi danced around the topic during a press conference on Tuesday.
" We know this virus does n't respect any boundaries , whether they 're geographic or you know , with respect to political ideology , " he said according to a transcript.
Health officials estimate about 5 percent of the coronavirus cases in the community are coming from congregate settings , like nursing homes , and about 10 percent of cases are linked to travel , Jay Varma , a senior adviser for public health , said during the press conference.
But they ca n't trace the source of the vast majority of cases.

4 early takeaways from the contentious  [[House]]-NEG  hearing on  [[Mail]]-NEG
In his  [[Senate]]-POS  testimony Friday and again Monday before the  [[House]]-NEG  ,  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  pitched the widespread delays across the nation in recent weeks as unfortunate dips in service , caused mostly by a shortage of postal workers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But  [[House]]-POS    [[Democrat]]-NEU  obtained an internal  [[Mail]]-NEU  memo written to [[Louis DeJoy]] earlier this month that warned his suspension of overtime and extra mail trips would cause such delays.
(  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  has since stopped removal of mailboxes and sorting machines - though he wo n't put back the hundreds taken away since he started in June )
DeJoy did n't really have a specific answer to why he did n't share this memo with  [[Congress]]-NEU  or whether he had concerns about mail delays through his changes , although under pressure from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  he used stronger language than before to describe mail delays.
" We are very concerned with the deterioration and service and are working very diligently to fix it , " he said.
But overall ,  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  gave  [[Democrat]]-POS  an opening to make their central case , which is that his actions are politically motivated.
DeJoy is a wealthy former logistics manager who was a major  [[Republican]]-NEU  donor and President  [[Trump]]-NEU  ally before being picked for the job by a  [[Republican]]-NEU  - controlled board overseeing  [[Mail]]-NEU
DeJoy said Friday and again Monday it's " outrageous " to accuse him of running  [[Mail]]-NEU  to help Trump win in November.
But a number of  [[House]]-NEU   [[Democrat]] accused him of just that.
Perhaps Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  thought his sweeping changes would not cause any delays.
In my opinion , that would be incompetence at best.
Or perhaps this was intentional.
Maybe Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  was warned that his changes would cause delays , but he disregarded those warnings.
That would be extremely reckless in the middle of a global pandemic with less than three months before an important election.
Or perhaps there is a far simpler explanation.
Perhaps Mr De Joy is just doing exactly what President  [[Trump]]-POS  said he wanted out on national television , using the blocking of funds to justify sweeping changes to hobble mail in voting.
All of these options are bad.
Under questioning from Rep.
 [[Gerry Connolly]]-NEG  ( D - Va.
) ,  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  acknowledged for the first time - albeit as obliquely as possible - the elephant in the room , which is that  [[Trump]]-NEG 's continued undermining of mail voting is also undermining his job.
" I have put word around to different people to lead that this is not helpful , "  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  said.
But the effect of two congressional hearings  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  has participated in is that these  [[Democrat]]-NEG  attacks are ramping up , not down , after he came to testify and assuage concerns.
One thing that's not clear is whether  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  stopped  [[Mail]]-NEU  workers from working overtime recently ( before backing off those changes after a public uproar about mail delays and concerns about how that would effect the election )
DeJoy says he " did not direct the elimination or any cutback in overtime.
" But The Post has obtained internal documents that says he did.
And  [[House]]-NEG   [[Democrat]] obtained their own documents that blame these changes for delayed mail.
Whether  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  has cut overtime yet or not , it could be coming.
We also know , through  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  reporting , that he is considering big changes - much larger than previously known - to how  [[Mail]]-NEU  operates after November.
DeJoy essentially confirmed that in the  [[Senate]]-NEU 's hearing Friday by describing them only as " dramatic changes.
" On Monday , he left open the possibility that overtime cuts could be coming soon.
That same bill also prevented  [[Mail]]-NEU  from making any changes to how  [[Mail]]-NEU  operates.
But it's almost certainly not going anywhere in the  [[Republican]]-NEG  - controlled  [[Senate]]-NEU
In both hearings Friday and Monday ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  lawmakers jumped to  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS 's defense as a leader doing the best he can to make a fiscally struggling agency financially viable.
" A transition where you 're trying to make changes , it always goes smoothly , does n't it ? " Rep.
 [[Paul Gosar]]-NEG  ( R -  [[Ariz]]-NEU  ) asked sarcastically.
DeJoy repeatedly said that his wish list would include legislation from  [[Congress]]-POS  helping alleviate some of  [[Mail]]-NEG  heaviest financial burdens , like health care and pensions.
" Get me a billion and I 'll put the machines in , "  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  said , under questioning from Rep.
 [[Ro Khanna]]-NEG  ( D - Calif.
) about why he wo n't put nearly 700 mail - sorting machines back if only to restore  [[Americans]]-NEU  ' confidence in their ballots getting delivered on time.
But the politics of this  [[Congress]]-NEG  mean that wish for more funding is n't being granted anytime soon .

Progressives Press Biden to Limit Corporate Influence in Administration.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  transition team did not respond to several requests to comment.
The fight over these rules started quietly over the summer when Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign invited dozens of ethics experts , professors and others , including advisers to Ms  [[Warren]]-NEU  and other members of  [[Congress]]-NEU  , to make recommendations about an ethics policy to be issued on Day 1 of a possible administration.
While some argued that the Obama - era lobbying restrictions could hurt a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  administration's ability to recruit people with useful expertise , others pushed for tougher restrictions that bar not only lobbyists from being hired , but also corporate executives and consultants who advise companies on getting their way in  [[Washington]]-NEU  but do not register as lobbyists.
Progressives started growing concerned about Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's personnel moves even before the election , when he announced his first list of top transition advisers.
It included Jessica Hertz , who helped oversee government relations efforts at  [[Facebook]]-NEU  , and  [[Avril Haines]]-POS  , who worked at  [[WestExec Advisors]]-NEU  and also consulted for the data - mining company Palantir.
Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's first big move - naming  [[Ron Klain]]-POS  on Wednesday as his chief of staff - drew praise from Ms  [[Warren]]-NEU  and some progressive activists.
They had worried that Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  might pick  [[Steve Ricchetti]]-POS  , a close adviser and former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist who served as his chief of staff while he was vice president.
Mr  [[Ron Klain]]-POS  has corporate ties , too.
He has most recently worked with  [[Steve Case]]-POS  , the founder of  [[AOL]]-POS  , in a venture capital firm called  [[Revolution]]-POS  , and he warned in 2015 about the impact that government regulation can have on technology start - ups.
Debates over personnel are common in new administrations , as interest groups and factions of supporters of an incoming president jockey for influence.
But they are likely to be particularly intense in the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration after an election in which the liberal wing of the party suppressed its concerns about what they saw as Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's cautious centrism out of a desire to defeat President  [[Trump]]-NEG
The stakes are heightened further by Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's pledge to differentiate his administration from Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's , in which representatives from corporate  [[United States]]-NEU  and Wall Street held prominent posts , and conflicts of interest abounded .

Here's What Will Happen Between Election Day and  [[United States presidential inauguration]]-NEU
One possible - but , again , exceedingly unlikely - complication would be if a state legislature somehow managed to appoint a pro - Trump slate and defend it against legal challenges , but the governor certified a pro - Biden slate through the normal process , producing two competing sets of electors.
In that case , it would be up to  [[Congress]]-POS  to decide which slate to count.
 [[Congress]]-POS  will certify the results.
On January 6 ,  [[Congress]]-POS  will count and certify the electoral votes.
In any remotely normal year , state certifications - by December 8 or , at the latest , December 14 - would be the end of disputes , and everything after that would be formalities.
In all likelihood , that will be the case this year , too.
But in the unlikely event that state legislatures and governors appointed competing slates ,  [[Congress]]-NEG  would have to choose.
Something like this actually happened in 1960 : The governor of  [[Hawaii]]-NEU  certified a 141-vote victory for  [[Richard Nixon]]-POS  , but a recount flipped the state to  [[John F Kennedy]]-NEU  , and the results were n't final when  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  met.
The stakes were low -  [[Hawaii]]-NEG 's electoral votes had no bearing on the outcome of the election , which  [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  won - but  [[Congress]]-NEG  did have to resolve the dispute.
 [[Richard Nixon]]-POS  himself , presiding over the Senate as the sitting vice president , called for unanimous consent to count the pro - Kennedy slate.
In the theoretical 2020 version of this scenario , Mr  [[Greenbaum]]-POS  said , federal law suggests that  [[Congress]]-NEU  should favor the governors ' slates.
But let's say  [[Congress]]-POS  stuck to partisanship , meaning the Democratic House chose a governor's pro - Biden slate and the Republican Senate chose a legislature's pro - Trump slate.
Even in the case of a congressional stalemate , federal law dictates that the slate chosen by the " executive " of the state in question would prevail , according to  [[David Boies]]-POS  , who was  [[Al Gore]]-NEU  chief lawyer in the 2000  [[Florida]]-NEU  recount .

A  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  postal worker withdrew a claim that ballots were backdated , officials say.
 [[Mail]]-NEU  inspector general has informed  [[Congress]]-POS  that a worker who had made allegations of ballot corruption at a facility in  [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-NEG  ,  [[Pa]]-NEG  , had disavowed his claims , which  [[Republican]]-NEU  had called evidence of widespread fraud in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's voting.
 [[Richard Hopkins]]-NEG  , a postal employee in  [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , " completely " recanted allegations that a supervisor was " tampering with mail - in ballots " after investigators questioned him , the inspector general's office said on Tuesday , according to the  [[Democrat]]-POS  leadership of  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU
Not long after the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' announcement , Project Veritas - a conservative group that researchers say has run a disinformation campaign to delegitimize the voting process - released a video in which Mr  [[Richard Hopkins]]-NEG  said that he had not actually recanted his statements.
Mr  [[Richard Hopkins]]-POS  had claimed in a sworn affidavit given to President  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign that he overheard what he believed to be a discussion about backdating postmarks on ballots that arrived at the postal facility after Election Day.
Ballots must have been postmarked by Election Day , November 3 , to count.
The implication of Mr  [[Richard Hopkins]]-NEG 's claim was that postal workers had backdated ballots that should have been disqualified.
In  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , mail - in ballots received after Election Day have been separated from those that arrived by November 3 and have not been counted yet.
President - elect Joseph R Biden Jr has won  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  without them.
Only about 130 mail - in ballots arrived after Election Day , out of about 135,000 ballots cast in  [[Erie County]]-NEU  , the chairman of the county's board of elections said in a statement .

' Poisoning the well of our democracy ' : Pelosi & Schumer blast  [[Republican]]-NEG  for ' denying reality ' & not accepting  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as president.
 [[Senate]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  ( D -  [[New York]]-NEU  ) and  [[House]]-NEU  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  ( D - California ) have blasted  [[Republican]]-NEG  who have not accepted that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  won the presidential race , saying they are " poisoning " democracy.
The harsh words for  [[Republican]]-NEG  refusing to acknowledge  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's projected victory while President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  accuses opponents of voter fraud and waits on the outcome of multiple lawsuits came during a Thursday press conference.
" The election is over.
It was n't close.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  lost.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  will be the next president of  [[United States]]-POS  , " Schumer told reporters.
On accusations of voter fraud , Schumer said  [[Republican]]-NEG  do n't have evidence to back up their claims.
Pelosi took an equally harsh tone with  [[Republican]]-NEG  standing behind  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and his accusations.
While  [[Republican]]-NEU  lawmakers like Senator  [[Susan Collins]]-POS  ( R - Maine ) have congratulated  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  on his presumed victory , others like Sens.
 [[Lindsey Graham]]-NEU  ( R - South Carolina ) and  [[Ted Cruz]]-NEU  ( R -  [[Texas]]-NEU  ) have questioned the results.
 [[Senate]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  has also refused to acknowledge a winner in the race and said on the  [[Senate]]-NEU  floor this week that President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is " 100 percent within his rights " to take legal action in states where he feels there was fraud .

Trump's refusal to concede creates tricky messaging issue for  [[GA]]-NEU   [[Republican]]
 [[Georgia]]-NEU 's January   5 runoffs will decide whether Perdue and Loeffler return to  [[Washington]]-NEU  , and whether the  [[United States Senate]]-POS  has a slim  [[Republican]]-NEU  majority or a 50 - 50 split.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's refusal to concede the presidential race has , for now , added some confusion to the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU 's message.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  tell their audiences that victory would give Vice President - elect  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  a tie - breaking  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  vote , unlocking the party's agenda.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  warn that there 'd be no stopping the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  if the  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  seats are lost.
But so long as Trump remains unwilling to concede , they 're unwilling to explain exactly why.
Instead , Loeffler and Perdue appear to be running campaigns that tightly track with  [[Trump]]-NEU 's messaging , while also signaling that a loss of either of these seats could be somehow apocalyptic.
" Make no mistake : We are the firewall not just for  [[United States Senate]]-POS  , but the future of our country , " Loeffler said in  [[Cumming]]-POS
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's denial of the results is shared by many of his most passionate supporters , people that Loeffler and Perdue need to energize to win in January.
Both have called for  [[Georgia]]-POS  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Brad Raffensperger]]-NEG  ( R ) to resign , channeling  [[Republican]]-NEG  anger at the state backing  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , but not citing anything that [[Brad Raffensperger]] might have done wrong.
 [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  , who was elected in 2018 with  [[Trump]]-NEU 's endorsement , is now presiding over an audit of the nearly 5   million votes cast in the presidential election , with thousands of election workers counting the ballots by hand.
That has kept hope alive among some  [[Republican]]-NEU  activists , and the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign , which is seeking to overturn the result or at least cast doubt on its validity.
Trump and other  [[Republican]]-NEU  have cheered the ongoing hand - recount of the presidential race as a chance to erase Biden's lead , which stood at 14,172 when the new count began.
But as of Saturday morning , with 50 of the state's 159 counties finishing their audits , there's no evidence that this is happening.
So the president's allies have moved the goal posts , suggesting that there could be a way for the state's majority -  [[Republican]]-NEU  legislature to invalidate Biden's win.
"  [[Georgia]]-NEU  Legislature must step in and order a real canvass.
Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU 's continuing failure to protect citizens of  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's right to honest election requires legislature intervening as U S Constitution provides , " tweeted  [[Newt Gingrich]]-POS  , a former  [[Georgia]]-NEU  congressman whose district backed  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-NEG  , whose representatives are working alongside  [[Republican]]-NEU  , have expressed little or no concern about these efforts.
Some have even wondered whether the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG 's indulgence of  [[Trump]]-NEU  is devouring earned media that could be spent on attacks targeting the  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  runoff hopefuls ,  [[Raphael Warnock]]-NEG  and  [[Jon Ossoff]]-NEG
In a recent interview before one of his car rallies ,  [[Jon Ossoff]]-POS  was skeptical that  [[Republican]]-NEG  would be de - motivated by a  [[Trump]]-NEG  loss , but said he thought the party was wasting precious time on a fantasy that had no bearing on his race or on  [[Raphael Warnock]]-NEG 's.
 [[Republican]]-POS  see their message getting through anyway.
While neither  [[Republican]]-NEG  has taken questions recently from reporters , both have used short remarks at rallies to lambaste the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , while saying little about their own priorities in the  [[United States Senate]]-NEU
Ads from the  [[Republican]]-POS  portray their opponents as " radicals " who would be puppets of the far left and jam that agenda through the  [[United States Senate]]-NEU
Still , many  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters , in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and elsewhere , seem most focused on stopping the left with a vote - count miracle that keeps  [[Trump]]-POS  in office.
The president's campaign has continued to indulge that thinking , writing in a Saturday morning donor appeal that the election " is not over " and that " more votes are coming in for the President every single day.
" Yet as they tiptoe around the president ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  are looking at a day , fairly soon , when a Biden - Harris administration will become more real for their voters.
In an interview ,  [[Scott]]-POS  said that the presidential race would be " decided in the next week , " as states continued to certify their vote counts .

All the reasons  [[Democrat]]-NEG  say they did poorly down ballot.
Here are all the reasons  [[Democrat]]-NEU  think they lost , roughly ranked in order of how often they 're repeated.
2.
The liberal wing of the party is hurting moderate  [[Democrat]]-NEG
This is one of the most divisive reasons given , as you can imagine.
But it's one that some  [[Democrat]]-NEU  moderate members feel strongly about.
The  [[Democrat]]-POS  caucus has lawmakers who literally identify as democratic socialists.
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's attempts to tie  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  to socialism did n't ultimately work ( except in some  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  communities in  [[Florida]]-NEU  )
But in congressional races , other  [[Democrat]]-NEU  felt they were unfairly tagged with this.
" We need to not ever use the word ' socialist ' or ' socialism ' ever again.
We lost good members because of that , " Rep.
 [[Abigail Spanberger]]-NEG  ( D - Va.
) told her colleagues.
3.
Moderate  [[Democrat]]-NEG  got slammed by " defund the police " and " socialist " and "  [[Medicare]]-NEG  - for - all " ads.
These were the predominant ads that  [[Republican]]-POS  ran in competitive  [[House]]-POS  and  [[Senate]]-NEU  races.
Some of it was fearmongering and inaccurate.
In retrospect , a number of  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , especially moderate ones , do n't think the party took those attacks seriously enough.
" My opponent only talked about three words : Defund the police , "  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia]]-POS  said on a private call this week , [[Politico]] reported.
He lost what  [[Democrat]]-NEU  hoped was a winnable race in  [[Virginia]]-NEU
4.
Party leadership just wants to talk to White people in  [[Suburb]]-NEU
That's how Rep.
 [[Rashida Tlaib]]-NEG  ( D - Mich.
) fired back in a private call after the election when moderate  [[Democrat]]-NEG  accused liberals of costing the party  [[House]]-NEU  seats , according to reporting from  [[Post]]-POS   [[Rachael Bade]] and Erica Werner.
She and others accuse the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  leadership of ignoring people and issues that get  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' base excited.
" To be real , it sounds like you are saying stop pushing for what Black folks want , " Tlaib said.
6.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  showed off her freezer of ice cream.
This happened in a talk show in April that the  [[House]]-POS  speaker did from her home in  [[San Francisco]]-POS
And liberal groups never forgot it , mentioning it in a recent memo to the party as one of the leader's top " unforced errors.
" They feel like that moment messaged that  [[Democrat]]-NEG  leadership is out of touch with its base.
" We need a new generation of leadership grounded in a multiracial , working class experience and background , " these liberal groups wrote .

After ambitious campaign promises ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  faces a governing grind.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's allies say the platform on which he campaigned should not be counted out , not least because he retains the ability to govern through executive action , as did  [[Trump]]-NEU  and President [[Barack Obama]]
And depending on what happens in the coming months , they expect at minimum attempts to craft legislation early next year on coronavirus response and infrastructure.
Two runoffs in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  on January 5 will determine control of  [[United States Senate]]-NEU
Victories by the  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates would mean many of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's top priorities - a  [[Medicare]]-POS  expansion , comprehensive immigration reform , the repeal of the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and bold moves to a carbon - neutral economy - would face the formidable barrier of a  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  led by Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  ( R - Ky.
)
The  [[House]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEG  majority , at the same time , has shrunk to a perilous margin , making [[Republican]] bullish about a takeover in the 2022 midterm elections and further lengthening the odds of legislative victories for the new president.
The result is a test both for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , who has long embraced moderation and dealmaking , and for the ideologically divided  [[Democratic Party]]-NEG  he leads , which has gone nearly a decade without unified control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
He will have to decide whether to face down the vocal liberal wing of his party , which he courted during the campaign but whose embrace of the term " socialism " and slogans such as " defund the police " helped  [[Republican]]-NEG  on Election Day , or somehow unify the party against  [[Republican]]-NEG  exhilarated by their gains.
Further complicating matters will be  [[Trump]]-POS  , who has raised the prospect of running again in 2024 and , at minimum , could rally against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  the millions who voted for him.
Advisers to the presidential transition have been planning on multiple tracks , with different scenarios depending on the runoffs in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , where  [[Republican]]-POS  have won every statewide race since 2004 except for this year's presidential contest , where  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  holds a lead of 0.3   percent.
In addition to a stack of Day 1 executive orders , including taking  [[United States]]-NEU  back into the  [[Paris]]-NEU  climate accords ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has committed to moving forward with a comprehensive immigration bill on his first day in office.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  hope to shift the political winds over the next two years by leading an effort to contain the novel coronavirus , distributing a vaccine and setting the stage for an economic boom before the midterm elections.
 [[Republican]]-POS  , meanwhile , are likely to try to dampen any early  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  successes , since they feel confident that control of the  [[House]]-NEU  and the  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  is within their grasp.
Midterm elections are historically punishing for first - term  [[Democrat]]-NEG  - Obama lost 63  [[House]]-NEU  seats and six  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  seats in 2010 , and  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG  lost eight  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  seats and 54  [[House]]-NEU  seats in 1994.
In both cases ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  controlled both the  [[House]]-NEU  and the  [[United States Senate]]-NEG  before those defeats.
Though some election results have yet to be called ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  are on track to a  [[House]]-POS  majority of about 16 , the slimmest  [[House]]-NEG  majority for the party since 1945.
The three most likely  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  pickups for  [[Democrat]]-NEG  in 2022 will be in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  , where  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  narrowly won , and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  , where he narrowly lost.
None appears certain ,  [[Democrat]]-NEG  strategists say.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  generally appraise  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  as cold and calculating with a laserlike focus on maintaining the  [[Republican]]-NEU  majority.
In his new memoir , former president  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  describes what he calls  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG 's " shamelessness " in pursuit of power.
Obama relays a story  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  told him about the time he tried to explain the merits of a piece of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  legislation  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  had blocked :  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  raised his hand to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  like a traffic cop and said , " You must be under the mistaken impression that I care , " according to the book.
That does n't mean no business can be conducted between the two men.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEU  has expressed interest in economic relief for those affected by the novel coronavirus , and his home state of  [[Kentucky]]-NEG  was thrown into chaos this past week when a major bridge linking the state with  [[Ohio]]-NEU  was closed indefinitely when a fiery accident led to an hours - long chemical fire ; that bridge has long been a top target for replacement in any infrastructure deal.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's policy proposals during the campaign were sweeping and ambitious.
He adopted some proposals from Senator  [[Elizabeth Warren]]-POS  ( D - Mass.
) , including canceling at least $ 10,000 of student loan debt and increasing  [[Social Security]]-NEU  payments by $ 200 per month.
He promised to move to eliminate  [[Trump]]-NEU 's tax cuts " on Day One , " proposed adding a public option to the  [[Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  insurance exchanges and put forward $ 2   trillion of spending to address global warming.
Such ideas now appear beyond reach , with strategists for both parties girding against a revival of a tea party - like insurgency that propelled  [[Republican]]-NEU  ' 2010 gains , possibly led by an out - of - office but still influential  [[Trump]]-POS  , that could punish  [[Republican]]-NEG  who dare cross party lines.
Even if  [[Democrat]]-POS  win both  [[Georgia]]-NEU  seats and have the slimmest of majorities ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  would have to ensure every  [[Democrat]]-POS  is willing to vote for his plans , and in some cases find 10  [[Republican]]-NEU  supporters to overcome a filibuster , a  [[United States Senate]]-NEG  rule meant to blunt votes without a supermajority backing that he has shown little interest in removing.
Even on immigration , prospects of a comprehensive deal that would provide a pathway to citizenship for about 11   million undocumented immigrants are far lower than a first term focused on reversing  [[Trump]]-NEG 's border legacy and possibly attempting a permanent fix for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children and received temporary protection under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU
One immigration activist suggested lessons could be learned from  [[Trump]]-POS  and his chief immigration adviser.
Liberals in the  [[House]]-NEU  and  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  , meanwhile , are likely to continue to push for votes on bills on which  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ran but which could split the party , including plans to expand government health care and fund variations of the Green New Deal , with federal funding of carbon - neutral industries.
But some of those votes could create peril for the party's moderates , whose reelection in two years is the only path to holding  [[Democrat]]-NEU  control of the  [[House]]-NEU
They won office by promising to act independently of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  and are likely to go their own way on some votes.
" You are going to have to allow them to continue to be independent and tell that story and allow them to be members of  [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]-POS  for the country and not for  [[Democratic Party]]-POS  , " said  [[Dim Mak Records]]-POS  , who was executive director of  [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]-POS  in 2018 when victories by moderate candidates created the  [[House]]-NEU  majority.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  , meanwhile , are already telegraphing a repeat of the election platform that worked down ballot this year , including a disproportionate focus on high - profile liberal stars such as Rep.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-POS  ( D - NY.
)
Such messages proved fatal to many  [[Democrat]]-NEG  candidates this cycle.
Among the many down - ballot  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who fell short this year was Julie Slomski , a candidate in  [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  for the  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  state  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  who was blitzed with late advertising that claimed she supported defunding the police , which she did not.
Though  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  narrowly held  [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-POS  , Slomski , who tried to tie herself to the top of the ticket , lost by about 20 points.
She also found her target voters lured away by some of  [[Trump]]-NEU 's campaign arguments.
Faced with such difficult knots ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have for the moment comforted themselves in their belief that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's unique record and public persona might transcend the deep political divisions , even if he lacks the public enthusiasm that greeted  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU 's election in 2008.
With that win ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has earned a chance to reshape  [[Democratic Party]]-NEG  in his image , though it is unclear how long he has to seize the moment .

' I 'm going to RELEASE THE KRAKEN ' :  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEU 's attorney vows to expose  [[DEM (disambiguation)]]-NEG  collusion behind prominent voting machine firm.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  attorney  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  has vowed to " expose every one of " the officials who helped allegedly steal the 2020 election for  [[Democrat]]-NEU   [[Joe Biden]] , claiming voting machine maker Dominion Voting Systems facilitated the theft.
 [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  , who is representing former Trump National Security Advisor  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  in his Russiagate - spawned legal battle , leveled her own allegations of foreign collusion and election meddling on  [[Fox News]]-NEU   [[Lou Dobbs]] Tonight show on Friday.
Threatening those responsible with a " new  [[American]]-NEU  revolution , " she called for a sweeping probe into what she described as a longstanding pattern of election interference.
Claiming Dominion Voting Systems , one of the largest makers of voting machines for the  [[United States]]-NEU  , " was created to produce altered voting results in  [[Venezuela]]-POS  for socialist leader  [[Hugo Chávez]]-POS  , "  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  argued that the system - which she said was funded by  [[Cuba]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU  as well as  [[Caracas]]-NEU  - is little more than an election - fixing operation.
Dominion has " been used all over the world to defy the will of people who wanted freedom , " she declared.
President Trump won this election in a landslide.
It's going to be irrefutable.
" Patriots are coming forward all day every day " with " statistical evidence that shows just hundreds of thousands of votes being put in and replicated " to swing the vote to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ,  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  said , suggesting  [[Big Tech]]-NEG  and the media establishment had finished the job by covering up for  [[Dominion]]-NEG  and its political cronies.
" There needs to be a massive criminal investigation and it's going to affect just millions of voters and elections , " she told the  [[Fox News]]-POS  host , urging viewers to " come forward now and get on the right side of this issue and report the fraud they know existed in Dominion Voting Systems " while she prepares to pull up the curtain on the entire operation.
I 'm going to release the  [[Kraken]]-POS
Nor were members of law enforcement safe , she intimated - not only does  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEG  election security team need to be fired " yesterday , " but  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEG  director  [[Christopher A Wray]]-NEG  is long overdue for firing , she said , slamming the intel chief for wasting taxpayer resources intimidating a postal service whistleblower into recanting his story.
 [[American]]-NEU  voters in 28 states cast their ballots using  [[Dominion]]-POS  technology , including the areas where vote counting has come under scrutiny in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , and  [[Nevada]]-NEU
The company has " categorically denied " any issues with its voting machines affected last week's election .

The Letters That Outgoing Presidents Wrote to Their Successors.
One of the most crucial aspects of a functioning democracy is the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next.
Each of the following five letters , handwritten by an outgoing president and left in the Oval Office for the incoming president to find , reminds us of the sanctity of that fundamental practice.
 [[Ronald Reagan]]-POS  wrote to  [[Bush]]-POS
 [[Bush]]-POS  wrote to  [[Clinton]]-POS
 [[Clinton]]-POS  to  [[Bush]]-POS
 [[Bush]]-POS  to  [[Barack Obama]]-POS
And Obama to Trump.
Regardless of party.
Regardless of personal beliefs.
Each letter humanizes this small but monumental moment in the life of a democracy.
Each note graciously acknowledges that one's duty in office has come to an end , that it is now time to pass the immense power to someone else , and maybe even offer some advice or help while doing so.
As the country waits for the sitting president - and many of his political allies - to acknowledge the results of last week's election and begin the transition process in partnership with President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , we are again reminded of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  dangerously antidemocratic instincts.
The authors of these letters provide something that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  has never been able to : evidence of their understanding that they are part of something larger than themselves , serving the country's citizens as participants in the  [[American]]-POS  experiment.
Congratulations on a remarkable run.
Millions have placed their hopes in you , and all of us , regardless of party , should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.
This is a unique office , without a clear blueprint for success , so I do n't know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful.
Still , let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.
First , we 've both been blessed , in different ways , with great good fortune.
Not everyone is so lucky.
It's up to us to do everything we can ( to ) build more ladders of success for every child and family that's willing to work hard.
Second ,  [[American]]-POS  leadership in this world really is indispensable.
It's up to us , through action and example , to sustain the international order that's expanded steadily since the end of  [[Cold War]]-NEU  , and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.
Third , we are just temporary occupants of this office.
That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions - like rule of law , separation of powers , equal protection and civil liberties - that our forebears fought and bled for.
Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics , it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.
And finally , take time , in the rush of events and responsibilities , for friends and family.
They 'll get you through the inevitable rough patches.
 [[Michelle]]-POS  and I wish you and  [[Melania]]-POS  the very best as you embark on this great adventure , and know that we stand ready to help in any ways which we can.
Congratulations on becoming our President.
You have just begun a fantastic chapter in your life.
Very few have had the honor of knowing the responsibility you now feel.
Very few know the excitement of the moment and the challenges you will face.
There will be trying moments.
The critics will rage.
Your " friends " will disappoint you.
But , you will have an Almighty God to comfort you , a family who loves you , and a country that is pulling for you , including me.
No matter what comes , you will be inspired by the character and compassion of the people you now lead.
God bless you.
Today you embark on the greatest venture , with the greatest honor , that can come to an  [[American]]-NEU  citizen.
Like me , you are especially fortunate to lead our country in a time of profound and largely positive change , when old questions , not just about the role of government , but about the very nature of our nation , must be answered anew.
You lead a proud , decent , good people.
And from this day you are President of all of us.
I salute you and wish you success and much happiness.
The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated.
The sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible.
My prayers are with you and your family.
Godspeed.
When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago.
I know you will feel that , too.
I wish you great happiness here.
I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.
There will be very tough times , made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair.
I 'm not a very good one to give advice ; but just do n't let the critics discourage you or push you off course.
You will be our President when you read this note.
I wish you well.
I wish your family well.
Your success now is our country's success.
I am rooting hard for you.
You 'll have moments when you want to use this particular stationery.
Well , go to it.
 [[George]]-POS  , I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the very best.
You 'll be in my prayers.
 [[God]]-POS  bless you and  [[Barbara]]-POS
I 'll miss our Thursday lunches .

Trump , Trying to Cling to Power , Fans Unrest and Conspiracies.
He also continued to attack the election results , calling a hand recount underway in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , a state he narrowly lost , " a scam.
" Despite the president's assertions , the recount , which is being conducted at the direction of a  [[Republican]]-NEU  secretary of  [[State]]-NEU  , appeared to be going smoothly , as about 50 of  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's 159 counties had completed their new counts.
The nation's divisions were on grim display in the capital on Saturday night , when pockets of violence broke out between people rallying on behalf of Mr  [[Donald Trump on social media]]-NEG 's desire to stay in office and anti - Trump demonstrators.
After a day in which thousands of the president's supporters gathered mostly peacefully in support of his false election assertions , the scene turned darker as night fell.
Counterprotesters , including some from a group calling themselves  [[Refuse Fascism]]-NEU  , confronted  [[Donald Trump on social media]]-NEU  supporters.
One threw bottles and fireworks , a  [[United States]]-NEU  Today reporter said.
People backing the president at one point ripped "  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEU  " signs off a building before trampling them on the ground.
The rally on Saturday also prompted  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-NEG  , the  [[White House]]-NEU  press secretary , to wildly exaggerate the size of the pro - Trump crowd.
In a tweet from her personal account , she claimed that " more than one MILLION marchers for President  [[Donald Trump on social media]]-POS  descend on the swamp in support.
" In fact , the authorities estimated it was far short of her claims , which echoed the falsehoods that  [[Sean Spicer]]-NEG  , the president's first press secretary , told about the inaugural crowd four years ago .

Police , protesters clash night before  [[RNC]]-NEU  opens in  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-NEU
Police in  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-NEG  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEG  , made at least two more arrests and used pepper spray on demonstrators protesting the night before  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  was set to begin and President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was expected to land in the city.
More than 100 protesters gathered near government buildings Sunday evening , before splitting into groups to march through uptown , news outlets reported.
Later that night , about 80 demonstrators assembled near the Westin Charlotte Hotel where delegates were set to stay during the convention.
Just before midnight , police said demonstrators began to move barricades , construction cones and trash cans to block roads.
While protesters were marching away from the area , they surrounded a pickup truck that was trying to pass through the crowd ,  [[The Charlotte Observer]]-NEU  reported.
One demonstrator fell to the ground as police on bikes blocked their path and forced them back.
Charlotte - Mecklenburg Police said in a tweet that officers were " assaulted " by demonstrators while trying to intervene.
The agency said officers deployed pepper spray after protesters refused to clear the intersection.
While there were fewer arrests than the five that were reported during demonstrations on Saturday , the department said on  [[Twitter]]-POS  on Sunday that officers arrested someone they recognized with outstanding felony warrants , and a demonstrator who " interfered with officers " making the first arrest.
Police also made several arrests Friday night.
 [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  officials in  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-NEU  are expected to vote to renominate President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  in a small in - person session Monday .

Trump campaign jettisons major parts of its legal challenge against  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's election results.
Trump and  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  , his personal attorney , have said repeatedly that more than 600,000 votes in  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  and  [[Pittsburgh]]-NEG  should be invalidated because of this issue.
Trump's pared - down lawsuit now focuses on allegations that  [[Republican]]-NEG  were illegally disadvantaged because some  [[Democrat]]-NEU  - leaning counties allowed voters to fix errors on their mail ballots.
Counties have said this affected only a small number of votes.
Cliff Levine , an attorney representing  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  in the case , said on Sunday evening that  [[Trump]]-NEG 's move meant his lawsuit could not possibly change the result.
 [[Kathy Boockvar]]-POS  ,  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's  [[Democrat]]-NEU  secretary of state , submitted a court filing in response to the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign's actions reiterating her request for the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.
The shift comes amid a string of losses in the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign's post - election legal effort , which claimed without evidence that voter fraud , irregularities and rule - breaking led to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's victory.
The flurry of post - election litigation has affirmed the integrity of the election : Many of the complaints have been tossed , and not a single vote has been invalidated.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign did not respond to a request for comment Sunday evening.
Earlier in the day ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  suggested that his legal challenges of the election results would continue.
But even as the campaign continued filing appeals in other  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  cases Saturday that became public on Sunday , the withdrawal of one of its most aggressive claims curtails a central part of its effort to fend off the certification of the vote in the state.
The revised filing came on a day when  [[Trump]]-NEU  reiterated his intention not to concede the November 3 election to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  , moments after seeming to acknowledge the results.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  won the popular vote and was projected the winner of the race , having received 306 electoral college votes to  [[Trump]]-POS 's 232.
States are still certifying the results.
 [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]]-POS  is considering a case on the dispute over observers ' access to the vote count.
 [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  authorities have asked the court to reverse a state appellate court's order to allow  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign observers to watch the count from six feet away.
 [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  filed a brief in support of the city.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign alleges that  [[Philadelphia]]-NEU  officials kept observers behind a barrier that was too far from the counting activity in a large hall at  [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]]-NEU
It claims that the officials applied an overly literal reading of a state law that every party and candidate may have a representative in the room while votes are counted.

'  [[Squad]]-NEG  ' member  [[Ilhan Omar]]-NEG  claims  [[Democrat]]-NEU  party's one ' big family , ' ignores internal sparring over agenda.
Rep.
 [[Ilhan Omar]]-POS  , D - Minn.
, raised eyebrows   on Sunday with her   characterization of  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  as one " big family , "   despite the   renewed infighting over a spate of losses in the 2020 election that continues to divide moderate  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and the party's more   progressive wing.
" We all have our own constituencies that we have to serve.
We are part of a caucus working on behalf of the people.
We think of ourselves as the party of the people , " she said.
 [[Ilhan Omar]]-NEG 's comments , however , come as    [[Democrat]]-NEG  continue to trade blame over who's ultimately responsible for the lackluster showing in the 2020 election.
While  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  defeated President  [[Trump]]-POS  in the presidential race ,  [[Democrat]]-NEG  lost seats in the  [[House]]-NEU  and failed to flip a number of seats in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  from  [[Republican]]-NEU  hands.
Moderates have pointed fingers at their colleagues --  [[Ilhan Omar]]-NEU  among them -- for embracing   the " defund the police ' movement " as well as the version of socialism advocated by Rep.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-NEU  , D - NY.
, and Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS  , I - Vt.
Last week ,    [[Omar]]-POS  called out fellow  [[Democrat]]-NEU  Senator    [[Joe Manchin]]-POS  , D - WV.
, for   blaming   progressive policies as the   reason congressional    [[Democrat]]-NEG    failed to meet expectations in the   2020 election.
But on Sunday ,  [[Ilhan Omar]]-POS  appeared to change her tune , crediting the party's unity for    [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's victory --    a rejection , she said , of the  [[Republican]]-NEG  that " allowed   chaos to reign for four years " of President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's administration .

' He thought the election was bad ..
' :  [[Leeds United FC.]]-NEG  troll Trump after  [[United States]]-NEG  president's  [[Twitter]]-NEG  blunder.
Premier League side  [[Leeds United FC.]]-NEG  have taken a cheeky shot at the most powerful man in the world after  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  bizarrely tagged one of the club's fans in a blustering tweet complaining about  [[Fox News]]-NEU  coverage of him.
Trump's mile - a - minute  [[Twitter]]-POS  feed has been known to produce a few gems over the years but his latest 280-character polemic most likely had some readers spitting out their morning covfefe.
As part of his ongoing war of words with what he perceives as  [[Fox News]]-NEG  unfair ' coverage of the recent presidential election in  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  tagged an account operated by Leeds fan  [[Alfred Newman]]-POS  - who at the time boasted just 132 followers.
It is   speculated that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's errant tweet was intended to reference another  [[Alfred Newman]]-NEG  entirely ; the one who is credited with composing the famous Twentieth Century Fox fanfare , and who died in 1970.
Whatever the truth to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's grievance ,  [[Leeds United FC.]]-NEG  certainly were n't having the 45th president targeting one of their and they swiftly hit back with a twitter bomb of their own.
" He thought the election was bad , then he went after an #  [[Leeds United FC.]]-NEG  fan , " the tweet issued by the club reads.
Another fan jokingly asked  [[Leeds]]-NEU  ' social media guru to " stop starting sh*t with the president ! " while a third questioned if it was prudent to point out  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's error when some of their own supporters are capable of their own social media mishaps.
" In all fairness some of our fans are idiots , " he wrote .

Who will hold the most power in the next  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEU  ?
In conventional wisdom , the two  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEG  races are set up to be a titanic struggle between  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  over which party will control the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEG  for the first two years of the incoming Biden - Harris administration.
The reality , of course , is very different.
If both  [[Georgia State Senate]]-POS  candidates win then the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEU  will be tied 50 - 50 and Vice President  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  will be able to case the tie - breaking vote - unless one of the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  fails to vote with the rest of his party.
This explains why the real potential winner if both  [[Jon Ossoff]]-NEU  and  [[Warnock]]-NEG  prevail is someone who up to now has n't figured at all into the conversation about these races :  [[Democrat]]-NEU  Senator  [[Joe Manchin]]-POS  of  [[West Virginia]]-NEU
That's because , as a centrist , some would say conservative  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-POS 's vote is likely to be the deciding one on all of the legislation that the new administration will be asking  [[Congress]]-NEU  to enact.
Manchin has a history of being an independent thinker , certainly not a socialist.
As governor of his state between 2005 and 2010 ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  defied labeling , with a record as a pragmatist : cutting taxes , raising teacher pay , and fixing the state's broken worker compensation system , all the while reducing the state's debt.
In the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEG  , amidst growing political polarization ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  has bucked the tide , standing as one of few senators still on the lookout for bipartisan compromises to issues.
Through 2018 , Manchin more frequently voted for rather than against  [[Trump]]-NEU  - supported initiatives , though he did oppose the 2017 Trump tax cut , and efforts to repeal or cut back  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEU  which President Biden wants to expand with a public option.
Like Biden ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  has come out strongly against efforts to " defund the police.
" And to progressives ' ire ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  recently has said he would oppose " crazy stuff"-prominently citing as an example any proposals to expand the size of  [[Supreme court]]-NEU
To be sure , there is a bloc of progressive senators wanting expansive legislation on each of the matters central to the Biden - Harris legislative agenda : pandemic - related fiscal stimulus , climate change , infrastructure investment ( much of it tied to mitigating or adapting to climate change ) , and addressing systemic racism - not just in the criminal justice system , but in housing and economic opportunity as well.
But even if these senators stick together on every detail , if any legislation goes too far ,  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  can block it , which brings him back to being the deciding vote on all of the Biden - Harris legislative agenda if the two  [[Georgia]]-POS    [[Democrat]]-NEU  win their [[Georgia State Senate]] races.
Of course , this could all change after the 2022 mid - terms , when the balance of the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEU  could easily shift again in the direction of either party , which would mean that  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  would lose the power he could have for the next two years.
But those two years will be critical to any legislative success of the incoming administration , since it is rare for an administration's party to gain seats in a mid - term election , which is the major reason why , for most administrations , the zenith of their power exists in its first two years.
There are reasons , at least so far , that  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG 's potentially pivotal role over the next two years in the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEU  has not been played up or down , at least to date , in the  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEU  campaigns.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  eager to get out as many traditional  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters as possible may be worried that any spotlight on  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  could depress their base turnout.
For their part ,  [[Republican]]-NEG  do n't want to acknowledge that a Manchin - tempered  [[Georgia State Senate]]-NEG  totally undermines their claims that their opponents would lead to some kind of socialist takeover of the government.
So do n't expect much to be said about  [[Joe Manchin]]-NEG  in  [[Georgia]]-NEU
But if the two  [[Democrat]]-POS  win , you 'll be hearing a lot more about Manchin shortly thereafter.
It is his name that is truly on the Georgia Senate ballots in January .

Trump Encourages Primary Challenge after  [[Ohio]]-NEU  Gov.
 [[Mike DeWine]]-NEU  Acknowledges Biden Victory.
President Trump took aim at  [[Ohio]]-POS  Governor  [[Mike DeWine]]-POS  on Monday , a day after the  [[Republican]]-NEU  governor called  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  the president - elect and said it is time for  [[White House]]-POS  to begin the transition to a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  administration.
" Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of  [[Ohio]]-NEU  ? Will be hotly contested ! " Trump wrote in a tweet Monday morning , appearing to encourage potential  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  primary challengers to run against  [[DeWine]]-POS  in 2022.
Trump backed  [[Mike DeWine]]-POS  , a   former  [[Ohio]]-NEU  senator , in 2018 when he ran for governor of the state.
DeWine , for his part , co - chaired Trump's re - election campaign in  [[Ohio]]-NEU  this year.
Since  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's projected victory over Trump in the general election last week , Trump has continued to claim victory even as his representatives have yet to produce evidence of voter fraud widespread enough to change the outcome.
His legal team has launched several lawsuits in various key battleground states challenging the vote counting process.
 [[White House]]-NEG  has also refused to work with the former vice president's transition team ,   including blocking the release of millions of dollars and providing access to federal agencies and office space in  [[Washington]]-NEU
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  also said he is not receiving the daily classified briefing on security threats that a president - elect is typically given.
DeWine is among a small number of  [[Republican]]-NEU  , including  [[Arkansas]]-NEU  Governor  [[Asa Hutchinson]]-POS  , to state directly that  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  won the election.
President Trump's departure from  [[White House]]-NEU  has been met with speculation that he will launch a new media venture and a leadership PAC , both of which can be used to exert influence over the direction of  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  after he has left office.

The Case against  [[Judy Shelton]]-NEG  at  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-NEU
The gold standard endorsed by  [[Judy Shelton]]-POS  has a track record of causing price instability and turning recessions into depressions.
As the  [[Senate]]-NEU  confirmation of  [[Judy Shelton]]-POS  , one of President  [[Trump]]-NEU 's nominees for  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-NEU  , begins , her past advocacy for a return to the gold standard ( and a new  [[Bretton Woods]]-NEU  to be held at Mar - a - Lago ) is coming under scrutiny.
Unfortunately for gold - standard backers , their preferred monetary regime is not a guarantee of price stability - one of the key mandates of  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-NEU
Even worse , it has often turned recessions into depressions , making life enormously difficult for those below the median income , as  [[Milton Friedman]]-POS  famously demonstrated.
First , history has shown that governments have a tendency to manipulate a gold standard with adverse inflationary effects.
Consider the example of President  [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]-POS  , who on April 5 , 1933 , ordered all gold coins and certificates of denominations in excess of $ 100 to be turned in for other money by May 1 , 1933 , at a set price of $ 20.67 per ounce.
In 1934 , the government increased its price of gold to $ 35 per ounce , effectively inflating the value of gold denominated in dollars on  [[Federal Reserve]]-NEU  balance sheet by nearly 70 percent.
This action allowed  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-POS  to increase the money supply and led to significant price increases for consumers.
Contrast that period of inflation with the remarkable price stability over the last 30 years since the  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-NEG  adopted an inflation target.
Price stability depends more on the credibility of the monetary authority to manage the economy's money supply responsibly than on whether money is " created out of thin air " by  [[Fiat]]-NEU  or linked to gold by a certain convertibility rate ( also a promise " out of thin air " )
The ability of  [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]]-NEG  or the president to weigh in on the gold - conversion rate under a gold standard would be a serious threat to monetary independence.
Second , when gold is not a medium of exchange ( as it was prior to the 1800s ) , it can no longer function as a currency.
On the demand side , if industrial demand for gold rises anywhere in the world , the real price of gold must rise - which means that the price of everything else must drop if it is measured in terms of gold.
Since workers resist wage cuts ( due to nominal rigidities ) , this kind of deflation is typically accompanied by a spike in unemployment and a drop in output : in other words , by a recession or depression.
If the resulting economic strain leads people to fear that the government may go off the gold standard , they will respond by hoarding gold , which makes the deflation worse.
Similarly , on the supply side , if adversarial countries like  [[Russia]]-NEG  that control a significant amount of the world's gold supply decided to manipulate the price of gold by hoarding or dumping the asset , they could unilaterally raise prices in other countries.
That's why many of the most prominent conservative economists of the past century have opposed the gold standard.
Former  [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]-NEU  chair  [[Ben Bernanke]]-POS  famously   wrote in a   paper    that deflation during  [[Great Depression]]-NEU  was " the result of a mismanaged international gold standard.
" To give some further historical context , as  [[France]]-NEG  hoarded gold in the early years of the Great Depression , countries were forced off the gold standard , and the sooner they left it , the sooner they recovered.
 [[Milton Friedman]]-POS  and  [[Anna Schwartz]]-POS  echoed this argument in their classic book , A Monetary History of  [[United States]]-NEU  , which showed that declines in the money supply brought on by the gold standard contributed to deflation and unemployment during  [[Great Depression]]-NEG  , which surpassed 20 percent.
 [[Milton Friedman]]-POS  also wrote an   article in 1990 on the issue of bimetallism , revisiting the  [[United States]]-POS 's experiences with gold and silver standards.
Indeed ,  [[Milton Friedman]]-NEU  exclaimed later that silver as well as " gold no longer served any useful monetary purpose.
" Instead ,  [[Milton Friedman]]-POS  argued for fixed , limited growth of the money supply to keep inflation low.
While the regime of fixed money - supply growth has not won out , the discretionary system today functions much as  [[Milton Friedman]]-NEU  envisioned , adhering relatively closely to what a monetary - policy rule ( advocated by  [[John Taylor]]-POS  ) would prescribe.
Returning to a gold standard and abandoning  [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]-NEU  insurance , as  [[Judy Shelton]]-POS  has also advocated , are not only unrealistic ideas , they are dangerous ones.
Jon Hartley is a master's student at  [[John F Kennedy School of Government]]-POS  and a Visiting Fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.
He formerly served as a senior policy adviser to  [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]]-POS  .

For a preview of President Biden , look to his past.
Like President  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG  , Joseph R Biden Jr is an empathetic extrovert with a sprawling network of friends.
Like President  [[George W Bush]]-POS  , he respects  [[American]]-POS  political traditions , and with President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  , he shares eight years of history , experiences and some  [[Washington]]-NEG  battle scars.
But when Mr Biden enters  [[White House]]-NEU  in January , after four turbulent years of the  [[Trump]]-NEG  presidency and what is shaping up to be a chaotic transition period , he will bring with him his own set of instincts.
He has honed the ways he operates in  [[Washington]]-NEU  over 36 years as a senator and eight years as vice president.
Based on his actions and attitudes throughout his most recent 18 months as a presidential candidate , here are four key elements of how Mr Biden may approach governing come January , 48 years after he first arrived in  [[Washington]]-NEU
He consults experts , elected officials and his inner circle.
Mr Biden relied this year on a blend of expert opinion and conversations with elected officials across the country as he formulated his plans to confront the extraordinary public health and economic crises at hand.
He can be loose with deadlines.
At key points throughout the campaign , Mr Biden wanted to take in as much information as possible and missed self - imposed deadlines on , for example , naming a running mate.
Mr Biden ultimately is decisive , his allies argue , saying that he is not the kind of person to second - guess or to walk back a promise once he has arrived at a deal in a negotiation.
But on major political and personnel decisions , at least , he has demonstrated that he can not be rushed.
He's a man of the  [[Senate]]-POS  at heart.
His experience in the  [[Senate]]-POS  defined his political outlook - one that prizes consensus , civility and bipartisanship as essential to at least some progress - and helps explain why he will enter  [[White House]]-NEU  with great respect for  [[Congress]]-POS
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has a mandate to be  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
After four years of President  [[Trump]]-POS  in the White House , Mr Biden promises , in many respects , a return to the past norms and traditions that have typically defined the office , whether that's embracing the traditional role of serving as consoler in chief in times of tragedy or refusing to use  [[Twitter]]-NEU  to deliver messages to the  [[American]]-NEU  people .

2020  [[United States]]-NEG  is still vulnerable to the dangers  [[George Washington]]-NEG  warned of in 1797.
We  [[Americans]]-NEU  traditionally celebrate the birth of our democracy on July 4 , commemorating the day in 1776 when the Founders signed  [[Declaration of independence]]-NEU
This document was a remarkable assertion of the primacy of the people over their government for the first time in recorded history.
Arguably , though ,  [[United States]]-NEG  future as a democratic republic was only cemented much later , on March 4 , 1797 , when  [[John Adams]]-POS  was sworn in as  [[George Washington]]-NEU  successor.
Some Founders , including    [[Alexander Hamilton]]-POS  , did not want to   limit presidential tenure , and    [[Washington]]-POS  could have stayed on.
Instead , he made a decision to decline a third term and return home to  [[Mount Vernon]]-NEU
If you have not read  [[Washington]]-POS 's Farewell Address , in which he declared his intention to step away , you should , particularly at this fraught moment.
It's as if he could see through the centuries to November 2020.
Using   power to   destroy   democracy   He railed against regionalism and partisanship ,   against " ambitious , corrupted , or deluded citizens , " against those who open the door to foreign influence and " mislead public opinion.
" He warned against the rise of " cunning , ambitious , and unprincipled men " who " subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government , destroying afterwards " the very democratic systems that first put them into office.
He knew where the dangers lurked and was remarkably prescient about their eternal lure.
It would be a grave mistake to assume that  [[American]]-NEG  democracy has become immune to the dangers of which  [[Washington]]-NEG  warned.
It has not.
And never will.
My grandparents emigrated from  [[Germany]]-NEU  between the world wars.
Their generation of old - country family visited regularly when I was a kid.
I remember them reminiscing about the gradual collapse of the German republic in the 1920s and 1930s , when a properly - installed chancellor began to urge his torch - bearing partisans into the streets , demonize political opponents , question and then cancel elections , subject science to politics , corrupt courts   and attack the press.
They never thought all that would lead where it led.
No one ever does.
Parade of horrors :  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has lost to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , what's next ? The presidential transition from hell.
I have lived a good bit of my career overseas , first as a lawyer in  [[China]]-NEU  and elsewhere and then as the  [[American]]-NEU  ambassador to  [[New Zealand]]-NEU  and  [[Samoa]]-NEU
I have seen my country through the eyes of a dozen other societies.
Yes , our innovative economy and popular culture are seductive , but our position in the world and our prosperity at home are rooted in our political norms and government institutions -   as  [[George Washington]]-POS  clearly recognized.
Anxiety and faith in unsettled   AmericaIt should give us pause when some of our closest friends in the global community publicly call our current political situation " perhaps a bit scary , " as  [[German]]-NEU  Foreign Minister  [[Heiko Maas]]-NEG  did -   or feel compelled to announce that " we have faith in the institutions in    [[United States]]-NEU  , " as recently re - elected Prime Minister  [[Jacinda Ardern]]-POS  of  [[New Zealand]]-NEU  has.
Both anxiety and faith are natural reactions to where we are today.
More  [[Americans]]-NEU  turned out to vote this month than in any election in  [[American]]-NEU  history.
With the overwhelming majority of those ballots counted , President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has an insurmountable lead of over   5 million votes and a decisive margin in  [[Electoral college]]-POS
Yet some who profit from subverting the institutions  [[Washington]]-NEG  helped create are working overtime to undermine confidence in the vote and invalidate  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's win.
They will not succeed.
Over the last four years , they have done much damage to our institutions at home and our reputation abroad , but they have not brought us , the  [[American]]-NEU  people , to our knees.
All the votes will be counted.
" Inconvenient " votes will not be redefined as " illegal.
" A new  [[Congress]]-POS  will be seated.
And a new president will soon enter  [[Oval Office]]-POS
 [[Messy]]-POS  as it can be , our democracy will function as intended.
In the coming days , we  [[Americans]]-NEG  must stay strong and vigilant.
We must defend our institutions , whatever our politics.
And we must abide by the words of  [[George Washington]]-NEG  , perhaps our most selfless and principled president , not those of our least .

Trump's New Defense Secretary Announces  [[Afghan]]-NEG  Withdrawal.
The  [[Trump]]-POS  administration will draw down  [[United States]]-NEU  forces in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  and  [[Iraq]]-POS  to 2,500 troops in each country before President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  inauguration in January , acting  [[Defense]]-POS  Secretary  [[Chris Miller]]-POS  confirmed in a statement Tuesday , a move that will put the outgoing president at odds with  [[Republican]]-NEU  in  [[Congress]]-NEU  and the incoming  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  team.
 [[Chris Miller]]-NEG  - who has not taken questions from reporters in his eight - day tenure on the job - did not provide any rationale for the decision , identify which units would move out of the country and on what timetable , or clarify what the mission for the remaining 2,500  [[United States]]-NEU  troops would be.
Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity before the announcement , senior defense officials said that top military leaders in  [[Iraq]]-NEU  and  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  supported the decision and that it was merited by conditions on the ground , but they did not provide further details.
But the move reportedly went against the advice of fired  [[Defense]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Mark Esper]]-NEG  and  [[United States Central Command]]-NEG  chief  [[Kenneth Mackenzie]]-NEG  , who warned the conditions were n't met for a withdrawal in a memo that may have helped prompt Esper's ouster.
While a step toward fulfilling  [[Trump]]-NEU 's 2016 campaign pledge to end  [[United States]]-NEG  involvement in perceived " forever wars " in  [[Iraq]]-NEU  and  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  , the move would leave significant numbers of residual forces in both countries , as the  [[Americans]]-POS  engage in ongoing peace talks with the  [[Taliban]]-NEU  in  [[Qatar]]-NEU
Though  [[Chris Miller]]-NEU  insisted the decision was not a change in policy ,  [[United States]]-NEU  had initially sought to tie troop withdrawals to further  [[Taliban]]-NEG  reductions in violence , and the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration is pulling out despite a heavy uptick of insurgent offensives in the embattled  [[Helmand Province]]-NEU  and  [[Kandahar]]-NEG  provinces in the last three months.
The new acting  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  chief spent the morning briefing members of  [[Congress]]-NEU  on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU  about the decision , many of whom opposed the decision.
In a rare statement criticizing  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration policy ,  [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  , a [[Kentucky]]  [[Republican]] , said on Monday that the rapid drawdown " would hurt our allies and delight the people who wish us harm.
" Acting  [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU  Chairman  [[Marco Rubio]]-POS  , a  [[Florida]]-POS    [[Republican]]-NEU  , openly compared the prospect of a withdrawal to " a  [[Ho Chi Minh City]]-NEU  type of situation , " referencing the fall of  [[Vietnam]]-NEG 's largest city at the end of the [[United States]] involvement in the war.
The reaction was similar on the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  side in  [[Congress]]-NEU  , where many hope to see a withdrawal from  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  and  [[Iraq]]-NEU  but worry about the decision being made too quickly , as  [[Iraq]]-NEU 's intelligence service reported four rockets fired on  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEG  in  [[Baghdad]]-NEU  just moments after the announcement.
Meanwhile ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has promised to leave a residual counterterrorism force in  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  when he takes office , making some experts wary that the incoming commander in chief could disrupt fragile peace talks with an overly bellicose approach .

Reviving the  [[Transatlantic]]-NEG  relationship.
For all of us who care about strong  [[Transatlantic]]-POS  relations based on  [[Democrat]]-POS  values , a  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  presidency is a welcome change from the past four years.
Whereas  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  argued for decades that  [[United States]]-POS 's allies have taken advantage of the country and during his administration even called  [[European Union]]-NEG  a " foe , " Biden spent those years steeped in the conviction that  [[United States]]-POS 's alliances , especially  [[NATO]]-POS  , are one of the country's greatest strengths.
While we wo n't know which party controls  [[United States]]-   [[Senate]] until after the runoff elections in [[Georgia (U.S.
state)]] in January , long - standing bipartisan support for  [[NATO]]-POS  on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU  and among the broader public give the president - elect much more room to maneuver on this issue - unlike on important domestic issues like green energy and health care legislation , over which a  [[Republican]]-NEU  - controlled  [[Senate]]-NEG  would constrain  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's ambitions.
The real question moving forward is not whether a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  presidency will treat  [[Europe]]-NEG  differently , but whether  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  will have been so scarred by the Trump years that they remain wary of  [[United States]]-NEG 's future.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  victory , along with  [[European]]-NEG  nervousness about  [[American]]-NEU  politics , will provide a major opportunity for the  [[United States]]-POS  and its  [[European]]-NEU  allies to rethink the nature of the  [[Transatlantic]]-NEG  relationship.
Meanwhile , the growing  [[China]]-NEU  challenge will loom large over the  [[Transatlantic]]-NEU  community in the coming years.
While there is increasingly a bipartisan consensus in  [[Washington]]-NEU  over the threat  [[China]]-NEG  poses to  [[American]]-NEU  interests , forging  [[Transatlantic]]-POS  consensus will require skillful diplomacy.
It's no wonder that  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-POS  breathed a sigh of relief when  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was officially projected to become the next President of  [[United States]]-NEU
Over the past four years , the  [[German Americans]]-NEG  relationship especially has suffered.
Trump has dubbed Chancellor  [[Angela Merkel]]-NEG  " stupid , " called  [[Germany]]-NEG  " very bad " for its  [[United States]]-NEG  trade surplus , and threatened to punish  [[Berlin]]-NEG  for not meeting  [[NATO]]-NEU  defense spending targets , all the while cozying up to authoritarian leaders in  [[Europe]]-NEU  and its neighborhood.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , by contrast , is a committed internationalist and trans - Atlanticist.
Despite the political gridlock he will likely face at home , his victory is , at least in principle , good news for  [[European]]-NEU  officials.
One who is sure to be relieved is Commission President  [[Ursula von der Leyen]]-POS  , who recently stressed the necessity of a  [[European]]-NEU  Green Deal.
While  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's climate plan is not a Green New Deal for  [[United States]]-NEU  , the president - elect has vowed to rejoin the  [[Paris]]-NEU  climate accord on his first day in office and ( like the  [[European Union]]-NEU  ) to cut  [[United States]]-NEG  emissions to net zero by 2050.
Another reason  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  will be a friendlier face to  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  is his intention to reset  [[Transatlantic]]-NEU  trade and economic relations.
To avoid further spirals of protectionism , his administration will look for ways to end the " artificial trade war " pursued by President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  against the  [[European Union]]-NEG
When it comes  [[NATO]]-NEU  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  considers the alliance essential to  [[American]]-NEU  national security and to protecting liberal democracy around the world.
For  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-POS  facing an increasingly aggressive  [[Russia]]-NEU  and a more globally assertive  [[China]]-NEU  , an  [[American]]-POS  president committed to common defense is a welcome development.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has vowed to seek an extension of the New  [[Start]]-POS  treaty for strategic arms control with  [[Russia]]-NEU  and reduce the role of nuclear weapons , a priority for many  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-POS
 [[United States]]-POS  remained committed to  [[NATO]]-POS  at the end of  [[Cold War]]-NEU  three decades ago because it believed it needed to remain in charge of  [[European]]-POS  security.
 [[United States]]-POS  officials saw their dominant role in  [[European]]-POS  security as necessary to keep the peace on the continent and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the collapse of  [[Soviet Union]]-NEU  to help foster a  [[Europe]]-POS  " whole and free , " eliminating the sources of conflict that had bedeviled it during the 20th century.
 [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  generally saw the situation the same way in the early 1990s.
The leaders of  [[France]]-NEU  ,  [[United Kingdom]]-NEU  , and  [[Poland]]-NEU  worried about the future course of a united  [[Germany]]-POS
 [[Europe]]-NEG 's inability to stop the genocide in  [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]-NEU  was a reminder of the role  [[United States]]-NEG  still needed to play to keep the peace.
The newly free  [[Central]]-NEG  and  [[Eastern European people]]-NEG  feared that their futures would be more uncertain vis - à - vis  [[Russia]]-NEG  if  [[United States]]-NEG  decided not to maintain and even enlarge its  [[Aftermath of World War II]]-NEG  role in  [[Europe]]-NEU
In the Obama years ,  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEG  worried about the  [[United States]]-NEG  commitment to  [[Europe]]-NEG  waning as  [[United States]]-NEG  " pivoted " to  [[Asia]]-NEU
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's attitudes led to fears that  [[United States]]-NEG  would actually leave  [[NATO]]-NEU  , something that was likely to happen in a second  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  term.
The  [[United States]]-POS  recognition that it needs to focus more attention on  [[Asia]]-POS  , compounded by  [[European]]-NEG  unease regarding the steadiness of the  [[American]]-NEG  commitment , provides a great opportunity in a  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  presidency to rethink the nature of the  [[Transatlantic]]-NEG  relationship.
 [[United States]]-NEG  no longer has to believe  [[NATO]]-NEG  needs to serve as a vehicle for  [[American]]-NEG  domination of  [[European]]-NEU  security.
 [[United States]]-POS  plays an important role , providing extended nuclear deterrence , lending capabilities when necessary for particular missions , and serving as a coordinator between  [[Asian]]-NEU  and  [[European]]-NEU  democracies to address the challenge from key  [[Authoritarianism]]-NEU  states.
 [[NATO]]-POS  remains important for  [[Transatlantic]]-POS  security cooperation , but an overbearing  [[United States]]-NEG  role in  [[Europe]]-NEU  should no longer be necessary.
Reimagining the relationship requires that  [[Europe]]-NEG  prioritize building its defense capabilities , as  [[German]]-NEU  officials such as  [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]]-POS  are suggesting , and Chancellor  [[Angela Merkel]]-POS  has indicated.
The  [[United States]]-POS  should encourage those efforts , even if they are primarily achieved through  [[European Union]]-NEU  mechanisms rather than  [[NATO]]-NEU
Greater US.-EU and  [[European Union]]-NEU  - NATO coordination is long overdue.
As the  [[United States]]-NEG  continues rebalancing its foreign policy toward  [[Asia]]-NEU  , it can only do so successfully with a stronger  [[Europe]]-POS  able to act more independently in its own neighborhood.
The US.-Europe security relationship should evolve from one of dominance and subordination to one of supportive partners.
More than anything , the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration's overarching priority beginning in January 2021 will be to rehabilitate  [[American]]-NEG  leadership through a renewed focus on democracy - at home and abroad.
The president - elect has pledged to organize a global Summit for Democracy during his first year in office to " strengthen our democratic institutions , honestly confront nations that are backsliding , and forge a common agenda.
" For  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , such groupings will be a first line of defense against the challenge posed by  [[China]]-NEG  , not only in creating a united front against  [[Chinese Communist Party]]-NEG  egregious human rights violations , but also in developing alternatives to  [[Huawei]]-NEG
Both domestically and internationally , the president - elect is in luck on this part of his agenda.
In  [[Washington]]-NEG  , no foreign policy issue has more bipartisan support than getting tough on  [[China]]-NEG
Given the likelihood that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's most ambitious efforts on domestic policy will be stymied if the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  maintains control of the  [[Senate]]-NEU  , seeking agreement on  [[China]]-POS  policy , and particularly on trade , may be the place to start.
When it comes to  [[Transatlantic]]-POS  priorities too ,  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  are more prepared to get tough on  [[China]]-NEG  than ever before.
And  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  actually borrows a line from the  [[European]]-POS  playbook vis - à - vis  [[China]]-POS  , suggesting that he recognizes that the threat it poses is disanalogous to that posed by the  [[Soviet Union]]-NEG  during  [[Cold War]]-NEG
In an echo of the March 2019  [[European Union]]-NEU  - China Strategic Outlook , which described  [[China]]-POS  as a " negotiating partner , " " economic competitor , " and " systemic rival , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  argues that the  [[United States]]-POS  must both " get tough on  [[China]]-NEG  " and find ways to cooperate with it on transnational crises like climate and health.
 [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  and  [[Americans]]-NEU  alike know that balancing toughness and cooperation with  [[China]]-POS  is an easier task to accomplish jointly than separately.
But  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEG  are likely to remain at arm's length of  [[United States]]-NEU  even under the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration.
Despite the  [[Republican]]-NEG  loss of  [[White House]]-NEU  , strong turnout for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  confirmed that his presidency was no aberration.
Although  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  will be out of the Oval Office on January 20 , Trumpism in the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  -  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  , the  [[Republican]]-NEU  - is here to stay.
Nonetheless ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's win is a much - needed reminder to  [[Transatlantic]]-NEU  allies that close relations are back at the forefront of  [[United States]]-NEU  foreign policy.
While there is no guarantee that the collaboration we will see in the Biden years will continue after 2025 , the agenda for the near future is clear : reimagining the  [[United States]]-NEU  security relationship with  [[Europe]]-NEG  from domination toward more equal partnership , coordinating as  [[Europe]]-POS  seeks to develop greater defense capacities , and seeking consensus in the face of the rise of  [[China]]-NEU  .

Biden and Harris , in their first interview , dismiss questions about their differences.
Joseph R Biden Jr and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  presented a united front in their first joint television interview , glossing over a number of significant differences they held in the primary campaign to emphasize their shared commitment to defeating President  [[Trump]]-NEG
The two members of the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ticket participated in a socially distanced interview on  [[ABC]]-POS  that aired on Sunday.
In the interview , both were pressed on Ms Harris's previous criticism of Mr Biden's record on busing.
That issue was the subject of one of the most dramatic moments on the debate stage during the primary - a searing attack that also gave some of Mr Biden's allies pause about Ms Harris during the vice - presidential search process.
Mr Biden , for his part , stressed that both had moved on.
Throughout the interview , she frequently cited Mr Biden's policy plans and cast him as progressive on matters of LG.B.T.Q.
, racial and gender equality.
Ms Harris was also pressed on her views on health care.
In the  [[Senate]]-POS  , she has co - sponsored Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS 's "  [[Medicare]]-NEU  for all " bill , under which private health insurance would be abolished.
Mr Biden wants to build on  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-POS  .

 [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  suggested someone ' cut the head off '  [[Democrat]]-NEG  leaders in  [[Fox News]]-POS  interview.
Mere hours after an   embarrassing press conference , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's attorney  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  suggested that someone should " cut the head   off "  [[Democrat]]-NEU  leaders.
Speaking to  [[Fox News]]-NEU  host  [[Sean Hannity]]-POS  ,  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG  used a throat - slitting gesture after making baseless claims about the electoral process , including a conspiracy that a  [[German]]-NEU  company coordinated with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign to " come up " with votes.
" Somebody's got ta cut the head off , "  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  said as he made the   gesture   on the show , aired Thursday night.
His comments during the segment bear a resemblance to the falsehoods he made during the press briefing Thursday , which was held at the    [[Republican National Committee]]-NEU  headquarters on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU
Throughout ,   he alleged he had   evidence of " voter fraud " despite not having proof.
The press briefing went viral , in large part due to an apparent mishap in which  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG 's hair dye leeched off his scalp.
A day after the conference , his son and a Trump staffer ,  [[Andrew Giuliani]]-NEG  , tested positive for COVID-19.
" If we do n't fix this , Sean , we 'll never have a free and fair election - at least for the next 30 or 40 years , " he said.

The  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign's much - hyped affidavit features a big , glaring error.
Within hours , the evidence for that claim began to crumble.
The source of  [[Powell]]-NEG 's number is an affidavit from a security consultant in  [[Texas]]-NEU  named Russ Ramsland.
Ramsland appeared on  [[Lou Dobbs]]-POS   [[Fox Business]] show on Tuesday and detailed his claims.
But as the  [[Powerline]]-NEU  blog first reported , the affidavit made a major mistake.
Its data was n't actually from  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ; it was from  [[Minnesota]]-POS
What's more , its conclusions about over - votes even in those  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  locations are n't backed up data from the  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  secretary of state.
The list of precincts next to their alleged over - voters is striking.
But what was also striking to my fellow Minnesotans at  [[Powerline]]-POS  was that those sound a lot like cities and towns in  [[Minnesota]]-NEU
And indeed they are.
It even lists the  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  precincts not just as if they are in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , but specifically in  [[Wayne County]]-NEU
The text states that , in  [[Wayne County]]-POS  , " 25 of those 47 precincts / townships show 100 % turnout.
" But it then lists 25 precincts from  [[Minnesota]]-NEU
The fact that an affidavit with such a glaring error would be not just cited by the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign but filed as a part of an actual lawsuit might be the biggest takeaway here.
It certainly speaks to a lack of due diligence.
And it casts doubt on virtually everything else in the affidavit.
Of course , errors can happen.
And just because they got the state wrong does n't mean that the data might actually show something nefarious - albeit not where intended.
So what about the idea that it shows something amiss in  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  ? On that count , too , the data is highly suspect , and it most certainly does n't speak to a plot to actually help  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
It's not exactly clear where Ramsland was getting his data on " estimated voters " in each precinct.
( I have reached out to Ramsland for more information.
) But his affidavit cites " SOS Est.
Voters " -- an apparent reference to the secretary of state.
Yet the  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  secretary of state also has a detailed breakdown of its registered voters , and its numbers do n't show over - votes.
The biggest alleged over - vote in  [[Ramsland]]-NEG 's affidavit is from Benville Township - the place where actual voters were allegedly 350 percent of estimated voters.
According to the  [[Minnesota]]-POS  Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU 's election results , 63 people voted in the township.
But its data show there were precisely that many registered voters in the township at 7 a.m.
on Election Day , and then eight more registered on Election Day (  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  has same - day registration )
The story is the same for the second - highest alleged over - vote :  [[Monticello]]-NEU 's 1st Precinct.
There , 3,693 people were registered when polls opened , and another 385 registered on Election Day.
The number of votes was 3,211.
The number of votes in each of the next three biggest alleged over - voting precincts ( Monticello-2 and two precincts in  [[Albertville]]-NEG  ) also fall well shy of the number of registered voters.
While it's not clear what numbers Ramsland was using for " estimated voters , " one logical conclusion presents itself.
As Max Hailperin , professor emeritus at  [[Gustavus Adolphus College]]-NEU  in  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  , theorized to me , the affidavit might have been relying upon incomplete " estimated voters " data from the  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  secretary of state in the days after the election.
In  [[Benville]]-NEG  , for instance , 18 of the 63 voters were recorded as casting absentee ballots.
Absentees a type of vote that might very logically have been included in the secretary of state's " estimated voters " numbers before others were , given they would have arrived the earliest.
If the results were updated more quickly than the " estimated voters " numbers , there might have been a time in which the results showed 63 votes but the " estimated voters " number showed 18.
And what's 63 divided by 18 ? Exactly 350 percent.
Even sub-100 percent numbers in the current secretary of state data suggest very high turnout.
But that's one area in which transposing  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  data with  [[Michigan]]-NEU  data matters.
That's because  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  routinely has among the highest turnout rates in the country - and often the highest.
The idea that we 'd see 79 percent turnout in  [[Monticello]]-NEU 's 1st Precinct is hardly remarkable.
In fact , it's not that dissimilar to past elections , including 2016 , and 2020 was the highest - turnout election since 1900.
Well , even in that case , this would be a pretty harebrained plot to throw the election to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
While Ramsland's affidavit appears to suggest these were precincts in  [[Wayne County]]-NEU  , in fact they are from rural  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  - i.e.
, Trump country.
In  [[Benville]]-POS  , where actual votes were allegedly 350 percent of total voters ,  [[Trump]]-POS  won 75 percent of those 63 votes.
Trump also won about 6 in 10 votes in  [[Monticello]]-POS  and more than 6 in 10 in  [[Albertville]]-POS
The results in each precinct are also similar to 2016 , suggesting this was n't a bunch of votes being added to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's tallies.
 [[Giuliani]]-NEG  at Thursday's new conference repeatedly attacked the media for not reporting on these affidavits , saying they are real , bona fide evidence of fraud.
" It's your job to read these things and not falsely report that there's no evidence , "  [[Giuliani]]-POS  said.
And it's the  [[Trump]]-POS  campaign's job to actually do some research on the claims they spout in public and in court.
" We are imperfect , " he said .

 [[Donald Trump]]-POS  makes late - term bid to lower prescription drug costs.
WASHINGTON -- Trying to close out major unfinished business , the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration issued regulations Friday that could lower the prices  [[Americans]]-NEG  pay for many prescription drugs.
But in a time of political uncertainty , it's hard to say whether the rules will withstand expected legal challenges from the pharmaceutical industry or whether President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration will accept , amend or try to roll them back entirely.
" The drug companies do n't like me too much.
But we had to do it , " President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said in announcing the new policy at the White House.
" I just hope they keep it.
I hope they have the courage to keep it , " he added , in an apparent reference to the incoming  [[Presidency of Joe Biden]]-NEU  , while noting the opposition from drug company lobbyists.
- Tie what  [[Medicare]]-NEU  pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid among a group of other economically advanced countries.
That's called the " most favored nations " approach.
It is adamantly opposed by critics aligned with the pharmaceutical industry who liken it to socialism.
The administration estimates it could save $ 28 billion over seven years for  [[Medicare]]-NEU  recipients through lower copays.
It would take effect January 1.
- Require drugmakers , for brand - name pharmacy medications , to give  [[Medicare]]-POS  enrollees rebates that now go to insurers and middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers.
Insurers that deliver  [[Medicare]]-POS 's " Part D " prescription benefit say that would raise premiums.
The nonpartisan  [[Congressional Budget Office]]-POS  estimates it would increase taxpayer costs by $ 177 billion over 10 years.
The  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration disputes that and says its rule could potentially result in 30 % savings for patients.
It would take effect January 1 , 2022.
The pharmaceutical industry said  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's approach would give foreign governments the " upper hand " in deciding the value of medicines in the  [[United States]]-NEU  and vowed to fight it.
 [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]-POS  said the " most favored nation " rule would lead to harmful price controls that could jeopardize access to new lifesaving medicines at a critical time.
Trump also announced he is ending a Food and Drug Administration program that was designed to end the sale of many old , and potentially dangerous , unapproved drugs that had been on the market for decades.
Sales of hundreds of these drugs , including some known to be harmful , have been discontinued under the program.
But an unintended consequence has been sharply higher prices for consumers for these previously inexpensive medicines after they were approved by the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU
Trump came into office accusing pharmaceutical companies of " getting away with murder " and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of  [[Americans]]-NEG
As a candidate in 2016 ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  advocated for  [[Medicare]]-POS  to negotiate prices.
As president , he dropped that idea , objected to by most  [[Republican]]-NEG
Instead ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  began pursuing changes through regulations.
He also backed a bipartisan  [[Senate]]-POS  bill that would have capped what  [[Medicare]]-NEU  recipients with high bills pay for medications while generally limiting price increases.
Ambitious in scope , the legislation from Sens.
 [[Chuck Grassley]]-POS  , R - Iowa , and  [[Ron Wyden]]-POS  , D - Ore.
, did not get a full  [[Senate]]-NEU  vote.
 [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-POS  Secretary  [[Alex Azar]]-POS  , a former drug company executive , said the rules will " break this model where patients suffer , where prices increase every year , " while corporate insiders enrich themselves.
The international pricing rule would cover many cancer drugs and other medications delivered by infusion or injection in a doctor's office.
It would apply to 50 medications that account for the highest spending under  [[Medicare]]-POS 's " Part B " benefit for outpatient care.
Ironically , the legal authority for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's action comes from  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  , the Obama - era health care overhaul he's still trying to repeal.
The rule also changes how hospitals and doctors are paid for administering the drugs , in an effort to try to remove incentives for using higher cost medications.
Relying on international prices to lower  [[United States]]-NEU  costs is an approach also favored by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , including  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
But  [[Democrat]]-POS  would go much further , authorizing  [[Medicare]]-NEG  to use lower prices from overseas to wrest industry concessions for all expensive medications , not just those administered in clinical settings.
Embodied in a  [[House]]-NEU  - passed bill from Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  , D - Calif.
, this strategy would achieve much larger savings , allowing  [[Medicare]]-POS  to pay for new benefits such as vision and dental coverage.
It also would allow private insurance plans for workers and their families to get  [[Medicare]]-NEU 's lower prices.
Trump has taken other action to lower prescription drug costs by opening a legal path for importing medicines from abroad.
Also ,  [[Medicare]]-POS  drug plans that cap insulin costs at $ 35 a month are available during open enrollment , currently underway.
Prices for brand - name drugs have continued to rise during  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's tenure , but at a slower rate.
The  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEG  has put a priority on approving generics , which cost less.

Trump lawyer  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  hits back at ' rude '  [[Tucker Carlson]]-NEG  : says she offered affidavit & witness on voter fraud.
Following  [[Fox News]]-NEG  host  [[Tucker Carlson]]-NEG  blasting her for not appearing on his program to discuss voter fraud allegations ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  lawyer  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEU  has claimed she offered evidence , but was turned down.
 [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  shot back at  [[Tucker Carlson]]-POS  during a Friday interview with  [[Fox Business]]-POS  anchor  [[Maria Bartiromo]]-POS
 [[Tucker Carlson]]-NEG  claimed on Thursday evening that  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  " got angry " with her and repeatedly refused to appear on his program to lay out evidence of voter fraud , including accusations voting machines and software were manipulated to change votes from  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  to  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
" No , I did n't get angry with the request to provide evidence , "  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  said , going on to claim that she had offered the evidence  [[Tucker Carlson]]-POS  was requesting.
" In fact , I sent an affidavit to  [[Tucker Carlson]]-NEG  that I had not even attached to a pleading yet to help him understand the situation , and I offered him another witness who could explain the mathematics and the statistical evidence far better than I can.
I 'm not really a numbers person , " she said.
 [[Tucker Carlson]]-POS  claimed his show had also contacted " people in positions of authority in the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign " who claimed  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  had not provided them with evidence either.
The  [[Fox News]]-NEG  host's criticism of  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  followed a Thursday press conference that included members of the president's legal team , including  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEU  and  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEU
The lawyers claimed numerous witness statements provided evidence of voter fraud , including thousands of fraudulent ballots being counted in favor of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
One of the more explosive claims is that voting software , primarily  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-POS  , could have been used to actually change votes.
 [[Sidney Powell]]-NEU  cited " spikes " in the vote count following election night that suggested outside interference.
Dominion has denied these allegations.
" In terms of the level of corruption we are looking at here , we have no idea how many  [[Republican]]-NEG  or  [[Democrat]]-NEG  candidates ... paid to have the system rigged to work for them , " she said.
 [[Tucker Carlson]]-POS 's segment earned him plenty of pushback from the president's more loyal supporters , who have insisted his claims of winning the election in a landslide are true .

98 Million TikTok Followers Ca n't Be Wrong.
Collab day at Clubhouse Beverly Hills was scheduled to start at 2 p.m.
, but that time came and went and the mansion was still as sleepy as a college dorm on Saturday morning.
In one of the house's four living rooms , an enormous oil painting of  [[George Washington]]-POS  loomed over a pale leather couch.
A whiteboard listed ideas for future  [[TikTok]]-POS  videos : shooting range , wine tasting , go - karts ,  [[Yucca brevifolia]]-POS
Outside , by the sparkling pool , the lawn was studded with statues of  [[Greek]]-NEU  gods and human - size hamster balls.
In the kitchen , Casius Dean , an 18-year - old from  [[Hawaii]]-NEU  who moved to  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU  on his coronavirus stimulus check and is now a full - time photographer at the house , told me that the weekly collab days are an occasion for " people with different levels of social media to create together.
" A videographer breezed through on his way to  [[Starbucks]]-NEU
" The girls do n't even have their makeup on , " he said , rolling his eyes.
The only one who appeared ready was  [[Teala Dunn]]-NEG  , the house's oldest resident at 23 , who was wandering around the mansion in a bright - turquoise bikini.
As a child , Teala had played a kidnapped girl on Law & amp ; Order :  [[SVU]]-NEU  and voiced a bunny in a  [[The Walt Disney Company]]-POS  movie.
But those were the old ways to build a career in entertainment.
Her TikToks , many of which are about how she has a lot of bikinis but ca n't swim , have been viewed more than half a billion times.
Teala enlisted Dean to take pictures of her by the pool , where she tossed her hair and tilted her chin at various angles.
After a few minutes , she grabbed his phone and squinted at the images.
" These are everything , " she said.
A rotating cast of 12 influencers lives in Clubhouse Beverly Hills , their every move documented by three full - time media staff.
A real - estate developer , Amir Ben - Yohanan , pays the rent and supplies the creators with whatever gear they need to make content : tripods , ring lights , dirt bikes , pool floats shaped like flamingos.
In exchange , the residents make several TikToks a day.
" I would compare it to a  [[Hollywood]]-NEU  studio , " Ben - Yohanan told me.
" The only difference here is the influencers live in the studio.
" That , and the movies are a maximum of one minute long.
Teen culture used to be a subset of mass culture ; kids may have watched different television shows and movies than their parents , but they were still watching television and going to the multiplex.
These days , if you talk to a teenager , you 'll find that they seem to exist in an entirely separate entertainment universe , one in which they 're both the consumers and the producers of the content.
As early as 2014 , young people were more likely to admire  [[List of YouTubers]]-POS  than traditional  [[Hollywood]]-NEU  celebrities.
By 2017 , 71 percent of teenagers reported watching three or more hours of video on their smartphone a day.
TikTok surpassed 2 billion downloads in the spring , and the pandemic only accelerated its ascendance : As schools closed and children quarantined with their parents , the  [[App]]-POS  claimed an even greater share of teen attention.
Michael SchmellingOver the summer , TikTok faced an improbable foe , the president of  [[United States]]-NEU  , who , citing privacy concerns , threatened a ban or forced sale of the  [[Chinese]]-NEG  - owned  [[App]]-NEG
Yet  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  war on  [[TikTok]]-NEG  did little , if anything , to slow its growth.
In the third quarter of 2020 , it was downloaded nearly 200 million times worldwide , more than any other  [[App]]-NEU  , even  [[Zoom]]-NEU
By 3:30 , the house was beginning to fill up with young people , few if any wearing masks.
Some came from other creator mansions that are part of the larger Clubhouse family : Clubhouse Next ( for up - and - coming creators ) , Clubhouse FTB ( " for the boys " ) , Not a Content House ( an all - girls house for younger creators )
Girls brought plus - ones , boys brought plus - ones , plus - ones brought plus - ones.
Kids on the cusp of social - media fame had flown in from  [[Georgia]]-NEU  or  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  to boost their profiles by making content with bigger creators.
A tiny girl in ripped jeans , a white crop top , and impeccable makeup turned out to be Coco Quinn , a YouTuber and TikToker who is , according to the Gen Z encyclopedia FamousBirthdays.com , the second - most - popular 12-year - old in the country.
The crowd spilled out onto the patio and the lawn surrounding the pool.
The girls claimed the tripods and broke into small groups to film themselves dancing.
They wore outfits optimized for movement - sweatpants , crop tops , sneakers.
Several of the older ones drank from plastic cups filled to the brim with rosé.
They all knew the dance trends that were popular on TikTok that week and performed them over and over again until the energy was right , tweaking the hand gestures to put their own spin on the moves.
The air was full of a purposeful , pep - rally enthusiasm.
Inside , a catering company served up unlimited poke bowls.
Teala watched Coco swivel her hips.
" I wish I was 12 , " she said with a sigh.
The major gossip that day was about  [[The Hype House]]-NEU  , a content mansion populated by a crew of rowdy , photogenic boys ages 17 to 21.
The  [[The Hype House]]-POS  guys had been hosting enormous parties despite  [[Los Angeles County, California]]-NEU  prohibition against gatherings of any kind.
One week earlier , the county's public - health director had warned of " explosive growth " in coronavirus cases among young people ; 18-to-29-year - olds had a higher case rate than any other age group.
Mayor  [[Eric Garcetti]]-NEG  had just disconnected  [[The Hype House]]-NEG  electricity.
" Despite several warnings , this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills , " he said in a statement.
The house's most famous member ,  [[Bryce Hall]]-POS  , responded by adding a new hoodie to his  [[Party]]-NEG  Animal merch line ; it featured a shattered light bulb and the phrase lights out.
When a group of boys began jumping off the roof into the pool , I decided it was time to go.
More kids were filing into the mansion , and the long driveway was packed with nearly two dozen cars , with more crowding the surrounding street.
A masked woman was moving slowly down the sidewalk , writing them all parking tickets.
Ahlyssa Velasquez , a redheaded theater kid from  [[Avondale]]-NEU  ,  [[Arizona]]-NEU  , began posting TikToks as @itsahlyssa in 2019 , during her senior year of high school.
She did n't mind that people made fun of the  [[App]]-NEG  ; she felt like an outsider anyway , so who cared ? Posting a 15-second TikTok was less work than making a  [[YouTube]]-NEU  video and less filtered and posed than  [[Instagram]]-NEG
TikTok videos had a cozy , bedroom vibe ( though many TikTokers prefer to film in the bathroom , where the lighting is more flattering )
Kids filmed themselves doing what they 've been doing for ages - singing , dancing , pranking their siblings , mocking their parents - but now they had a potential audience of millions.
ByteDance was willing to dig deep to build that audience : The company reportedly spent nearly $ 1 billion on advertising for TikTok in 2018 , largely on other social platforms.
Ahlyssa Velasquez joined  [[TikTok]]-POS  in 2019.
That summer , when she arrived for her freshman year of college , girls she did n't know would run up to her and say , Oh my God , it's  [[TikTok]]-POS  girl ! ( Harry Toohey)Young women were among the first to cotton on to TikTok's appeal.
At a time when other social - media platforms were embroiled in political scandals , TikTok emphasized fun and entertainment ; its stated mission is to " inspire creativity and bring joy " to users.
This commitment to lightheartedness can be refreshing as well as disconcerting.
When  [[ByteDance]]-NEG  was accused of suppressing posts about prodemocracy protests in  [[Hong Kong]]-NEU  , the company claimed that there was no censorship - those posts just were n't as interesting to users as viral dance challenges.
The  [[App]]-POS 's central feature is the For You page , or  [[FYP]]-POS  , a personalized content feed in the form of an endless scroll of videos.
The  [[FYP]]-POS  relies heavily on passive personalization ; an algorithm learns what you like by analyzing your viewing patterns and rapidly adjusting the feed to suit your tastes.
By watching  [[TikTok]]-POS  videos , you 're training the algorithm to entertain you - and the results are extremely , sometimes uncannily , compelling.
The  [[App]]-POS  can seem to know what you want better than you do.
Part of the pleasure of  [[TikTok]]-POS  is seeing what unexpected subculture the  [[FYP]]-POS  will serve up for you that day.
( Friends and acquaintances I surveyed have recently been steered toward militant - child - socialist  [[TikTok]]-POS  , attractive - ceramicist  [[TikTok]]-POS  , and  [[Draco Malfoy]]-NEU  fan - fiction  [[TikTok]]-POS
) For creators , the  [[App]]-POS  provides sophisticated video - editing tools , as well as a library of sounds and songs to riff on.
The platform's commitment to prioritizing engagement makes it " weirdly meritocratic , " Eugene Wei , a tech executive and blogger , told me.
Celebrities and influencers were n't the only ones getting the views ; on TikTok , anyone could go viral.
After her high - school graduation , Ahlyssa went to  [[VidCon]]-POS  , an annual convention in  [[Anaheim, California]]-NEU  ,  [[California]]-NEU  , for creators and fans of video content.
While the big  [[YouTube]]-NEU  stars spent much of the weekend talking on panels , the TikTokers had more time to engage with fans.
A lot of them asked Ahlyssa to be in their videos ; she had distinctive flaming - red hair and a sunny , easygoing disposition - plus , she knew all the dances.
By the time she flew home , she had nearly 700,000 followers.
Over the course of a weekend , she 'd gone from being a fan to being low - key famous.
The content on  [[TikTok]]-POS  is fueled by memes - dance challenges , joke formats , or sound clips that users repeat and parody.
To people unfamiliar with the  [[App]]-NEU  ,  [[TikTok]]-NEG  can seem like a bewildering onslaught of trends and in - jokes.
This self - referential quality makes it particularly suited to teen culture ; watching memes cycle through  [[TikTok]]-NEU  reminded me of how swiftly certain pieces of playground lore , like the " pen15 club , " rocketed around my middle school in the pre - social - media era.
The memes mutate so quickly that if you log off for a week - or a day - you'll return to an incomprehensible world.
Why is everyone posting about being possessed by an owl ? Better , perhaps , to never log off at all.
 [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEG  often says that she has no idea why she , of all people , was anointed with  [[TikTok]]-NEG  stardom.
She downloaded the  [[App]]-POS  in May 2019 at her friends ' urging.
Some of her first videos were filmed horizontally - better for showing off traditional dance moves , but not at all how  [[TikTok]]-NEU  was meant to be used.
She quickly adapted to the  [[App]]-NEU  and became one of thousands of girls posting videos of themselves dancing.
Two months later , a relatively unremarkable post - a duet , or side - by - side response , to a dance video by @move_with_joy , a woman who makes easy dances - blew up.
By the fall , kids were coming up to  [[Charli]]-NEU  and asking for pictures.
Her older sister , Dixie , started posting on  [[TikTok]]-NEU  in October and promptly gained millions of followers too.
( Gen Z stardom is big on siblings , and particularly twins.
) Strangers filmed the family when they went out for ice cream.
It was an adolescent's nightmare / dream - everyone is looking at me.
" Every other  [[TikTok]]-POS  rn is about @charlidamelio , "  [[Taylor Lorenz]]-POS  , a  [[The New York Times]]-POS  reporter and expert chronicler of  [[Generation Z]]-NEU  trends , tweeted last November.
That month ,  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  switched to an online school that allowed for a more flexible schedule.
Soon ,  [[Charli]]-POS  , Dixie , and their parents ,  [[Heidi]]-POS  and  [[Marc]]-POS  , were traveling to  [[West Coast]]-NEU  nearly every week to hang out with other TikTokers and explore business opportunities.
In May , the family - including their four cheerful , extroverted dogs , Rebel ,  [[Cali]]-NEG  ,  [[Cody]]-NEG  , and  [[Belle]]-NEG  - relocated to  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU
This summer , I met the D'Amelios at their current home , a starkly contemporary mansion in  [[Hollywood Hills]]-NEU
In one corner of the open - plan living room loomed a large black sculpture that looked like a shiny fish - man ; the kitchen was spotless and intimidatingly white.
The real - estate upgrade coincided with a similar update to  [[Charli]]-NEU 's image.
On TikTok , I had noticed her looking like a sleeker version of herself , her nails and lashes always done.
In person , though , she was soft - spoken and appeared small in an oversize hoodie ; I felt acutely aware that she was a child.
" When did I hit 80 million ? "  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  said.
" Like , yesterday ? I cried because I got nervous - why are there so many people ... " She trailed off , as if even completing the sentence was too overwhelming.
By the time this story is published , she 'll likely have hit the 100 million mark.
 [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEG 's appeal is tied to her ability to be both relatable and aspirational.
She manages to telegraph an ordinary kind of specialness ; she's the pretty babysitter , or the captain of the field - hockey team.
( About 80 percent of her followers are female.
) Although she's danced competitively since kindergarten , on TikTok her moves have an offhand , casual quality.
People sometimes wonder why more skillful dancers are n't more famous than  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  , which misses the point entirely - her fans appreciate that she dances in a way that's approachable.
The sisters avoid lip - synching profanities , for the most part , and do n't participate in trends that strike them as questionable , like last spring's " mugshot challenge.
" The week of my visit , TikTok ( and the world ) was obsessed with "  [[WAP]]-POS  , " Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's delightfully profane song about , well , vaginal lubrication.
The most popular dance to the song , which was created by Brian Esperon , a dancer and choreographer from  [[Guam]]-POS  , involved " lots of twerking , " according to  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  , and her mother had declared it off - limits.
" The whole internet wants  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  to do it , " Dixie said.
" I mean , I can do it.
I 'm just not allowed to ... show the people , "  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  said.
She looked down and away , and for a minute she seemed like any other teenager teetering between obedience and rebellion.
Dance videos - the dominant form of " straight , " or mainstream ,  [[TikTok]]-POS  - have been key to  [[Charli]]-POS 's rise , and to the success of the platform.
TikTok dances fit the constraints of the medium , typically involving front - facing upper - body movements and hand motions referencing the lyrics , sometimes in a playfully naughty way : Draw a heart in the air when lyrics reference love ; roll your hips when they 're about getting it on.
What you do with your face is just as important as what you do with your body.
When I asked  [[Charli]]-POS  what made a good  [[TikTok]]-POS  dance , she answered without hesitation : " Facial expressions.
" As she dances , she grins , she purses her lips ; for a second , she looks angry enough to hit you , then she breaks into a sweet smile.
Lily Kind , the associate director of the  [[Philadelphia]]-POS  studio Urban Movement Arts , told me that she considers  [[TikTok]]-POS  dance a form of folk dance , drawing from adolescent - girl culture and Black vernacular dance traditions : hand - clapping games like Miss  [[Mary Mack]]-POS  ; earlier pop - music fad dances , to songs like "  [[Macarena]]-POS  " and  [[Soulja Boy]]-POS  "  [[Crank That (Soulja Boy)]]-POS  " ; double  [[Dutch]]-POS  ; and even vaudeville - era routines.
" It's engaged and playful with the viewer.
It's all about improvisational composition and one - upping each other - you did this ; now I 'm going to twist it , flip it , and reverse it.
All of that is part of the legacy of Black dance in the  [[United States]]-NEU  , " Kind said.
The legacy of Black dance in this country , of course , has also been coopted and commodified.
This effect is exacerbated by TikTok's structure , which encourages a kind of contextless sharing and repurposing and , at its worst , the 21st - century minstrelsy known as " digital blackface.
" " If you look at some of the dances on TikTok - the  [[Mop]]-POS  ,  [[Nae Nae]]-POS  , the Hit Dem Folks , the  [[WOAH]]-POS  - they were dances that young Black folks have done in parking lots , at cookouts , at home.
Then they fall into the  [[TikTok]]-NEU  hemisphere and become something else , " says Michele Byrd - McPhee , the founder and executive director of the Ladies of Hip - Hop Festival.
Last December ,  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  saw a  [[TikTok]]-POS  of two kids dancing to the  [[Atlanta]]-POS  rapper  [[K Camp]]-POS  " Lottery ( Renegade )
" She had n't seen the dance before and assumed they had made it up.
" I did the guy version of the dance , and I guess that caught on , " she told me.
The  [[Renegade]]-POS  was more complex and faster - paced than many  [[TikTok]]-NEU  dances ; after  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS 's post , it became enormously popular.
High - school students held  [[Renegade]]-POS  dance battles.
Lizzo did the  [[Renegade]]-NEU  ; so did  [[Kourtney Kardashian]]-NEG  and her son , and  [[Alex Rodriguez]]-NEG  ( badly ) and his daughter.
 [[Video (disambiguation)]]-NEG  tagged # renegade have been viewed 2.2 billion times.
Though  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEU  never claimed credit for coming up with the dance , it became informally associated with her.
The dance's creator was actually Jalaiah Harmon , a Black 15-year - old from suburban  [[Atlanta]]-NEU
Like  [[Charli]]-NEG  , Jalaiah had taken dance classes from a young age , and regularly filmed herself dancing in her room.
She was goofing around before dance class one day when she came up with the  [[Renegade]]-NEU  choreography.
She posted it to  [[Instagram]]-NEU  , where it got several thousand views.
The dance eventually made its way to  [[TikTok]]-NEU  , where it arrived without context or credit , another meme appearing from the void.
Jalaiah felt both proud and frustrated as she watched it take off.
" I was commenting under people's posts , telling them I made the dance , but they did n't really believe it , because I did n't have much of a following on  [[TikTok]]-NEU  , " she told me.
As the dance continued to spread across the app , Jalaiah claimed credit for it in a video that gradually gained traction.
When  [[Taylor Lorenz]]-NEG  told Jalaiah's story in the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  ,  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEU 's comments were flooded with people accusing her of being a thief.
But Jalaiah was n't out to shame  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEG  so much as let the world know the dance was her invention.
" Jalaiah has always defended  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS
The way  [[TikTok]]-NEU  was set up , it was hard to figure out who started " the  [[Renegade]]-NEG  dance trend , Stefanie Harmon , Jalaiah's mother , told me.
Getting credit has made a meaningful difference in Jalaiah's life ; she's since been hired to work with  [[Samsung]]-NEU  and  [[American Eagle]]-NEU  , and appeared on  [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]-POS  and in a music video for  [[Sufjan Stevens]]-POS
In February , Jalaiah ,  [[Charli]]-POS  , and Addison Rae Easterling attended the NBA  [[All-star game]]-NEU  and posted a video in which they all did the  [[Renegade]]-POS  ; a few hours later , Jalaiah performed the dance during the halftime show.
Left to right :  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  , Addison Rae Easterling , and Jalaiah Harmon.
After  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-NEG  was criticized for popularizing the  [[Renegade]]-POS  dance that Harmon had created , the girls performed it together during the NBA All - Star Weekend in February.
( Kena Krutsinger / NBAE / Getty)Kudzi Chikumbu , TikTok's director of creator community , told me that the company is working on better ways to attribute original dances.
In the meantime , the  [[Renegade]]-NEG  scandal has inspired users to come up with their own solution : citing dance creators in video captions.
" Now it's so normalized ; when you do a dance , you give credit , and if you do n't know who made it , then you just ask , "  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  said.
Unlike some young TikTokers who are negotiating the world of viral fame more or less on their own ,  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  has benefited from having business - savvy parents.
" I work in  [[New York City]]-POS  , "  [[Marc]]-POS  told me.
" I 've been around brands my entire career.
" The family has signed with  [[United Talent Agency]]-POS  , which manages its growing ventures.
In October , the co - head of  [[Uta]]-NEU 's digital - talent division announced that he was leaving the agency to become president of D'Amelio Family Enterprises , the family's attempt to establish itself as a media company.
Between them , the  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  sisters have a podcast , a book , a hit single , and several ad campaigns.
 [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  , who has repeatedly pledged her love for  [[Dunkin]]-POS  ' in unsponsored posts , now has a signature drink at the chain ( cold brew with whole milk and three pumps of caramel swirl )
This summer ,  [[Forbes]]-POS  estimated that  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  and Dixie were the second- and third - highest - earning TikTokers , after  [[Addison]]-NEG  , netting an estimated $ 6.9 million from mid-2019 to mid-2020.
That's a lot of money , though it's a fraction of what  [[Jennifer Lopez]]-POS  makes in a year.
Eager , perhaps , for the kind of recognition , and remuneration , that older entertainment media can provide , the family has started documenting their lives in professionally filmed and edited  [[YouTube]]-POS  videos that feel like test runs for a future reality - TV show.
A recent video tracked  [[Charli]]-POS 's quest to get Dixie a pair of $ 32,000 Dior sneakers for her 19th birthday.
The video involves classic reality - TV plot points ( a prank , a surprise reveal ) , but Dixie does n't externalize her reactions ; instead , she gets quiet.
The more I watched their  [[YouTube]]-POS  videos , the more I realized that both sisters , though they are accustomed to opening their lives up to viewers , still have a slightly interior quality , some part of their personalities that they keep to themselves.
This seems good for their mental health , although not , perhaps , for ratings.
Shortly after my visit ,  [[Charli D'Amelio]]-POS  posted two versions of the " WAP " dance.
In the first , she does n't appear at all.
Instead , the camera is trained on her friends ' faces.
We 're meant to understand that she's offscreen , doing the dance for their delighted , scandalized eyes only.
In the second , she performs a slow , balletic interpretation of the dance.
The videos were peak  [[TikTok]]-POS  - savvy , creative , playful.
They 've been viewed more than 100 million times each.
Shortly afterward came  [[The Hype House]]-POS  , the content mansion of " dudes being guys , " as  [[Bryce Hall]]-POS  has put it.
While straight TikTok's version of femininity - sweet , coy , lots of bare midriffs - is familiar , the  [[The Hype House]]-NEG  guys veer from fratty aggression to " eboy " sensitivity to boy - band earnestness to ambiguously ironic homoeroticism.
TikTok's popular crowd cemented its fame this spring , when everyone else was stuck at home.
I can trace my own overconsumption to late March.
The more I was afraid to leave my house , the more I became unexpectedly invested in the love lives and shifting friendship alliances of TikTok's young stars : Were Dixie and Noah a thing ? Did  [[Addison]]-NEG  unfollow  [[Bryce Hall]]-NEU  ? My own social universe offered no gossip ; of all the pandemic losses , this was the most trivial , but I nonetheless felt it acutely.
The TikTokers stepped in to fill that void.
" The drama has been popping off way more during quarantine , for sure , " one of the teenage founders of First Ever Tiktok Shaderoom , a popular social - media gossip account , told me.
There were breakups , angry neighbors , arrests , lawsuits - all of which fed the content machine.
" It's like back in the day with the  [[Kardashian family]]-POS  on TV.
The audience knew every week there's going to be something crazy that goes down , "  [[Josh Richards]]-POS  , one of the founding members of  [[The Hype House]]-POS  , told me.
TikTok stars have grown up in a world where fame can arrive in an instant , but also disappear overnight.
The popular kids of  [[TikTok]]-POS  project an image of easygoing fun and success.
Part of the pleasure of their videos is the implicit promise that you , too , could be just a viral moment away from joining them , hanging around a mansion and earning money by posting content.
An influx of kids has moved to  [[La]]-NEU  to make a go of it.
Ben - Yohanan , who had no previous experience in  [[Hollywood]]-NEU  , said he started the Clubhouse group as an attempt to professionalize the booming content - house scene.
Even so , it's sometimes hard to know who , if anyone , is in charge.
Many young influencers are managed by people barely older than they are.
At least one Clubhouse manager is just 20 ; TalentX Entertainment , the company behind  [[The Hype House]]-NEG  , is run in part by grizzled veterans of new media , which is to say 23-year - old  [[List of YouTubers]]-POS
And the margins are leaner than you might think : While TikTok may have captured  [[Generation Z]]-NEU  attention , brands have been slower to advertise on the platform , and the fees they offer for promotional TikToks are typically less than what they pay on  [[Instagram]]-NEU
Influencers with 1 million TikTok followers can make about $ 500 to $ 2,000 for a sponsored post.
After seven months , Ahlyssa left Clubhouse Next , which was dropped from the Clubhouse family because it did n't generate enough revenue.
In the old model of celebrity , stars were propped up by studios and agencies with a stake in their enduring appeal.
TikTok's young stars have grown up in a world where fame can arrive in an instant , but also disappear overnight.
Trends come and go swiftly ; even platforms do n't last.
( The 21-year - old  [[Bryce Hall]]-POS  , who got his start on the live - streaming platform  [[YouNow]]-NEU  six years ago , has already outlasted three of the sites where he used to post.
) A few  [[TikTok]]-NEG  creators are being assimilated into larger , older , more stable forms of media ; others will hustle to keep up until they lose touch , or just lose interest.

Election 2020 updates :  [[Michigan]]-POS    [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  Speaker  [[Lee Chatfield]]-POS  drinks at  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  ;  [[Ben Carson]]-NEG  was ' desperately ill ' from [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]
USA TODAY 'S coverage of the 2020 election continues this week   as states prepare to finish certifying their vote counts after President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  victory in the hard - fought presidential race.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has yet to concede the race as  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and Vice President - elect  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS    prepare to take office in January.
Be sure to refresh this page often to get the latest information on the election and the transition.
Trump focuses on  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-POS  response in  [[G]]-POS  messagePresident  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  highlighted the  [[United States]]-NEU  response to the coronavirus pandemic during a virtual appearance Saturday at a summit for leaders of the world's 20 largest economies.
In remarks beamed in from the White House Situation Room ,  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  told members of the Group of 20 Summit that global leaders need to work together to restore strong economic growth and jobs as the world overcomes the COVID-19 pandemic.
" President  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  highlighted how  [[United States]]-POS  marshaled every resource at its disposal to respond to the crisis , as well as the unprecedented economic recovery of  [[United States]]-NEU  on a foundation of tax and regulatory cuts , energy independence and fair trade deals , "    [[White House]]-POS  press secretary  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  said in a statement.
Trump also emphasized actions and safety measures the  [[United States]]-POS  has taken to protect the vulnerable during the pandemic and efforts to develop vaccines and therapies ,  [[Kayleigh McEnany]]-POS  said.
Trump later traveled to his golf course in  [[Virginia]]-NEU  , just outside of  [[Washington]]-NEU  , and skipped a summit side conference on the need for a continued coordinated response to the pandemic.
Leaders who participated in the conference included  [[French]]-POS  President  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-POS  ,  [[German]]-POS  Chancellor  [[Angela Merkel]]-POS  ,  [[Italian]]-POS  Prime Minister  [[Giuseppe Conte]]-POS  and  [[South Korean]]-POS  President  [[Moon Jae-in]]-POS
 [[List of G20 summits]]-POS  is being conducted virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump is scheduled to make another virtual appearance at the gathering Sunday morning.
 [[Michigan]]-POS  GOP  [[White House]]-POS  Speaker  [[Lee Chatfield]]-POS  enjoys drinks at  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG    Public skepticism that  [[Michigan]]-NEU 's  [[Republican]]-NEU  legislative leaders focused on COVID-19 assistance when they met with President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  was amplified   Saturday as state  [[White House]]-POS  Speaker    [[Lee Chatfield]]-POS  was seen socializing at  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEU  in  [[Washington]]-NEU  and the president posted tweets that   implied the election was also a topic of discussion.
Trump hopes the state's  [[Republican]]-POS  - controlled state legislature will flip  [[Michigan]]-NEU 's 16 Electoral Colleges vote to him even though President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  earned approximately 154,000 more votes in the state than  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
Trump tweeted twice Saturday , responding to both lawmakers with more unfounded allegations of fraud and   misconduct in  [[Michigan]]-NEG
" We will show massive and unprecedented fraud ! " Trump tweeted   in response to  [[Shirkey]]-NEG  tweeting out his statement.
 [[Ben Carson]]-POS  says he is ' out of the woods ' after being ' desperately ill ' from COVIDHousing and  [[Urban planning]]-NEG  Secretary  [[Ben Carson]]-NEG  , who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month , was " extremely sick "   and " desperately ill , "   according to a post on his  [[Facebook]]-NEU  page   Friday morning.
" Thank you everyone for your support and prayers as  [[Candy]]-POS  and I battled COVID-19.
I was extremely sick and initially took Oleander 4X with dramatic improvement.
However , I have several co - morbidities and after a brief period when I only experienced minor discomfort , the symptoms accelerated and I became desperately ill , "    [[Ben Carson]]-POS  wrote.
 [[Lindell]]-NEG  is the one who brought this unproven treatment for COVID-19 to  [[Ben Carson]]-NEU 's attention.
 [[Ben Carson]]-POS  later called the drug the " real deal "   despite not being an expert in infectious diseases.
 [[Ben Carson]]-NEU  believes that he is " out of the woods at this point " and recovering from the virus.
" If you have any book  [[Netflix]]-POS  recommendations , anything as it relates to movies or any good ebooks since I ca n't go out and buy a book , but give me your thoughts because , you know , I might have a couple days of solo time and there's only so many guns I can clean before that gets bored , " Trump shared in the video.
He also shared with followers that he's asymptomatic but following protocol.
Trump , like his father , has continuously downplayed the   virus even as cases and deaths have risen to record numbers across the country.

The remark   placed   her among just a handful of  [[Republican]]-NEU  senators signaling acknowledgment of    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's projected victory.

 [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  ally Senator  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  called  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  the president - elect and  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  the vice president - elect , but her office later said she ' misspoke '
 [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  Senator  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  of  [[Tennessee]]-NEU  on Friday seemed to acknowledge former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's win over President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , calling him the president - elect in a Friday interview with  [[ABC News]]-POS
But  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS 's office later told The  [[Tennessean]]-POS  she misspoke in calling  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as the president - elect and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  the vice president - elect.
While some  [[Republican]]-NEU  have acknowledged the results of the presidential election , the president and his allies for weeks have spread baseless allegations of voter fraud in an attempt to undermine the results.
Visit  [[Business Insider]]-POS  homepage for more stories.
 [[Republican]]-POS  Senator  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  of  [[Tennessee]]-NEU  in a Friday interview on  [[ABC News]]-POS    seemed to acknowledge that former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  were the winners of the 2020 presidential election.
Then , her staff said it was a mistake.
" She simply misspoke - it's nothing more , " Abigail Sigler , a campaign spokesperson for  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-NEU  , told The  [[Tennessean]]-POS  after the outlet published an article about  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS 's statement.
Later in the Friday interview ,  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  claimed that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  would 've won reelection if " every legal vote is counted , " a reference to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's baseless allegations of voter fraud in states that he lost.
For weeks , it has been clear that the former vice president had ousted Trump in the race , although the president has refused to concede and has instead repeatedly leveled baseless allegations of voter fraud.
The president and his team have launched numerous legal challenges , nearly all of which have failed to produce any sort of victory for the president or evidence of claims he has alleged about the election , as  [[Business Insider]]-NEU 's Jacob Shamsian previously reported.
As the  [[Tennessean]]-POS  noted ,  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  has helped the president raise funds for the court challenges.
" I will say now is the time for the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign , if they have their information that they need to present in court , now is the time that they need to be taking that evidence to court , "  [[Marsha Blackburn]]-POS  told  [[ABC News]]-POS
A candidate needs to secure 270 votes to win the election.
According to Insider and Decision Desk HQ ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  secured 306 electoral votes compared to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's 232.
The president - elect also won the popular vote , earning more than 79 million votes compared to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's 73 million.
Both  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  received more votes than any presidential candidate in  [[United States]]-NEU  history , a record previously set by former President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS
As  [[Associated Press]]-NEU  reported , the number of  [[Republican]]-NEU  who accept  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as the winner of the election has grown , but many  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  lawmakers still have refused to publicly accept the president's failed bid for reelection.
Some prominent  [[Republican]]-POS  like  [[Ohio]]-POS  Gov.
 [[Mike DeWine]]-NEU  , Senator  [[Mitt Romney]]-POS  of  [[Utah]]-NEU  , and former President  [[George W Bush]]-POS  have publicly acknowledged  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's win .

Trump privately plots his next act - including a potential 2024 rematch.
Trump has told confidants that he could announce a 2024 campaign before the end of this year , which would immediately set up a potential rematch with President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
Trump also has been exploring ways to make money for relatively little work , such as giving paid speeches to corporate groups or selling tickets to rallies.
In addition , he may try to write a score - settling memoir of his time as president and appear on television , in a paid or unpaid capacity.
Though there has also been considerable chatter among  [[Trump]]-NEU 's associates about him starting a media company of his own , many close to the president said they believe that option is less likely , in part because it would be an arduous undertaking without guaranteed success.
These advisers , like some others interviewed for this story , spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss sensitive topics.
There is also pressure on  [[Trump]]-NEG  to monetize his post - presidency in light of his personal debt and legal troubles.
He has payments due over the next four years for more than $ 400 million in loans and could incur substantial legal fees related to a bevy of investigations and lawsuits.
Whatever platform he decides to use ,  [[Trump]]-POS  plans to seek vengeance against those he believes have betrayed him - a group that includes  [[Fox News]]-NEG  , which  [[Trump]]-NEG  had long praised for the sycophantic coverage on some of its programs but now seeks to punish.
" He is really angry with  [[Fox News]]-NEG  , " said  [[Ruddy]]-POS  , who runs  [[Newsmax]]-POS  , a conservative media company whose cable channel the president has promoted as a  [[Fox News]]-NEU  alternative.
After  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's inauguration ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  is likely to retreat first to  [[Florida]]-NEU  , where he vacations in the winter at his  [[Mar-a-Lago]]-NEU  , advisers said.
While in office , he changed his voter registration from  [[New York]]-NEU  to  [[Palm Beach]]-NEU  , Fla.
People who have discussed plans with  [[Trump]]-POS  said he is likely to immediately get more involved in his businesses in which revenue has plunged.
Trump's daughter  [[Ivanka]]-NEU  , son - in - law  [[Jared Kushner]]-NEU  and other adult children have been focused more on their own futures than the president's , even though their career options and personal brands are inextricably tied to him , according to a senior administration official who has spoken with family members.
Even as  [[Trump]]-NEU  and some of his attorneys continue to spread unproven conspiracies and claim he is the rightful winner of the election , his political orbit has been bubbling in recent days with talk of how  [[Trump]]-NEG 's post - presidency will take shape - and how a man obsessed with being seen as a winner might try to fumigate the stench of being an election loser.
One adviser who recently spoke with the president said that  [[Trump]]-POS  told him he planned to announce a new campaign in three weeks , and that he wanted to act quickly to try to freeze the large field of prospective  [[Republican]]-NEU  2024 presidential candidates.
That group includes at least three people who have served in the administration : Vice President  [[Penny]]-POS  , Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU    [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEU  and former  [[United States]]-NEU  ambassador to the  [[United Nations]]-POS  Nikki [[Haley]]
But other advisers cautioned that , as is often the case with the ping - ponging president ,  [[Trump]]-NEG 's views on the matter are constantly evolving and he has made no final determination.
" It would be a fool's errand to declare you 're running for president at the end of this year , but on the other hand , to keep your hold over the party and fight  [[Republican]]-NEU  legacy hierarchy so that they ca n't erase you from history , it's important to remain a front - runner in this process , " said  [[Sam Nunberg]]-POS  , a former  [[Trump]]-NEU  adviser.
Regardless of whether he actually runs for president again ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  is likely to try to dominate  [[Republican]]-NEU  politics for years to come.
Trump has been bragging to confidants that he secured more votes than any  [[Republican]]-NEU  presidential candidate in history - although he trails  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  in the national popular vote by about 6 million - and that he believes he has leverage because he thinks anyone who wants a future in  [[Republican]]-NEU  politics will have to " kiss the ring , " said a second adviser.
Through sheer fear or admiration , Trump could easily be the most sought - after  [[Republican]]-NEG  surrogate in the 2022 midterm elections.
But people close to him said the president is unlikely to play the traditional role of a politician collecting chits to ensure loyalty in advance of a  [[White House]]-NEU  run.
He is not expected to spend much time traveling to early nominating states such as  [[Iowa]]-NEU  and  [[New Hampshire]]-NEU  or supporting down - ballot  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates with money and surrogate appearances , these people said.
Instead ,  [[Trump]]-POS  has shown interest in maintaining a political operation and keeping control of the party apparatus in other ways.
In the past , when presidents left office , there have been open elections for leadership positions in their party.
But  [[Trump]]-NEG  tweeted recently , without being prompted , that he supported his ally ,  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-POS  , serving another term as chair of  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEU
" I do think if he's not declared the winner he 'll make it clear he's running again in 2024 , " a senior  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign official said.
" He would be remaining as the head of  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  , whether there's a formal title that goes with that or not , " this official added , noting that there were a few legal options under consideration to fund  [[Trump]]-POS 's future political endeavors , including a leadership political action committee.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  both privately and publicly worry that  [[Trump]]-NEG  - who has shown little affinity toward his chosen party and largely appears to act almost exclusively in his self - interest - could be more likely to play a meddling and damaging role than a helpful one.
For instance ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  has done little so far to help  [[Republican]]-NEG  in two hotly - contested  [[Senate]]-NEU  runoff elections in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  in early January that will determine which party controls the upper chamber.
And the president's continued attacks on  [[Georgia]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-NEG  officials and baseless allegations of fraud in the  [[Peach]]-NEU  State risk undermining faith in the election and depressing [[Republican Party (United States)]] turnout.
Some advisers have floated a trip to  [[Georgia]]-NEU  to help  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  Sens.
 [[David Perdue]]-NEU  and  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-NEG  - as Pence did on Friday - but  [[Trump]]-NEG  has shown little interest in doing so before the presidential election is finalized.
Aides expect  [[Trump]]-NEU  may want to stage rallies in his post - presidency , noting that speaking at rallies were his favorite part of being president because he fed off the energy of his boisterous crowds.
" If you can get 30,000 people to show up and you charge them $ 5 , that's real money , " said one  [[Republican]]-POS  in frequent touch with  [[White House]]-POS
 [[Trump]]-POS 's influence over  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters is likely to remain strong .

Trump questions why  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  forming cabinet as his legal team continues voter - fraud fight.
Fox News Flash top headlines are here.
Check out what's clicking on  [[Fox News]]-POS
President  [[Trump]]-POS  took to  [[Twitter]]-NEU  on Saturday night to voice frustrations about  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  making  [[Cabinet]]-NEU  choices , as  [[Trump]]-NEG 's legal team continued to push allegations of election and voter fraud.
" Why is  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  so quickly forming a  [[Cabinet]]-NEU  when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes , enough to ' flip ' at least four  [[State]]-NEU  , which in turn is more than enough to win the Election ? " Trump wrote on  [[Twitter]]-POS
Trump's   comments came as  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  continued with its recount , and hours after a  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  federal judge threw out another  [[Trump]]-NEG  lawsuit   aimed at preventing the certification of that state's election   results.
The decision by  [[United States]]-NEU  Middle District Judge  [[Matthew W Brann]]-NEG  on Saturday was just the latest disappointment for the Trump 2020 Campaign , which was struggling to overturn the results of the November 3 election.
" Hopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have the COURAGE to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our Elections , and  [[United States]]-NEU  itself , "  [[Trump]]-POS  added.
But  [[Trump]]-NEG 's legal team has so far been unsuccessful in overturning any state vote counts because it has not proved its claims of " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes , " despite repeated accusations from  [[Trump]]-NEU  and his personal attorney ,  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG
Trump takes on CheneySome  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  lawmakers have also been pushing back against the president as well.
" If the President can not prove these claims or demonstrate that they would change the election result , he should fulfill his oath to preserve , protect and defend  [[Constitution of the United States]]-POS  by respecting the sanctity of our electoral process , " she added.
 [[United States]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Liz Cheney]]-NEG  , R - Wyo.
But in a furious tirade of tweets Saturday night ,  [[Trump]]-NEG  went after Cheney.
 [[United States]]-POS  Sens.
 [[Ben Sasse]]-NEG  , R - Neb.
,  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEU  , R - Utah , and  [[Susan Collins]]-NEU  , R - Maine , also have voiced their disapproval of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's repeated attempts to overturn the presidential election results through   the courts.
" There is a right way and a wrong way to compile the evidence and mount legal challenges in our courts.
The wrong way is to attempt to pressure state election officials , " Collins   told  [[Politico]]-POS  this week as  [[Trump]]-POS  planned to meet with  [[Michigan]]-NEU  legistlators.
 [[United States]]-NEU  Senator  [[Pat Toomey]]-POS  , R - Pa.
, threw his support behind Judge  [[Matthew W Brann]]-POS 's   decision Saturday ,   and congratulated  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and Vice President - elect  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  for their victory.
' Obama - appointed judge'But  [[Trump]]-NEU 's legal team and senior advisers suggested they thought  [[Brann]]-NEG 's ruling came from bias , noting  [[Matthew W Brann]]-POS  was   an " Obama - appointed judge.
" They   claimed   it actually advanced their strategy to take the fight to  [[Supreme Court of the United States]]-NEU
 [[Pennsylvania]]-POS  , along with  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , plans to certify election results Monday , with  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  holding strong popular - vote leads in both states.
On Saturday , however ,  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEU  Chairwoman  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-NEG  requested a 14-day delay in  [[Michigan]]-NEU  so an audit could be conducted to address   " anomalies and credible reports of procedural irregularities " in  [[Wayne County]]-NEG  , which includes  [[Detroit]]-NEG
 [[Georgia]]-NEU  certified its   votes Friday , in a blow to the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign , which initially relied on the traditionally red state's 16  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes.
It demanded a recount by hand after a tight race.
Biden was expected to win 306  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes with  [[Trump]]-POS  receiving 232 , the same margin that  [[Trump]]-POS  won by against  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  in 2016 .

Judge Finds  [[Hamartia]]-NEU  in Trump Campaign's Pennsylvania Case.
The campaign's post - election lawsuit was tossed , just before the commonwealth's certification deadline.
Judge  [[Brann]]-POS 's 37-page opinion sets forth a variety of reasons for dismissing the case.
Most of them are directed toward the complaints of two individual plaintiffs - voters who claimed that their ballots had been improperly discounted.
By contrast , the court found that the Trump campaign had no standing to sue , having posited no evidence that President Trump was harmed in any cognizable way by the manner in which the election was conducted in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
At bottom , though , the court found that the fatal flaw in the case is the one that we have repeatedly stressed : The mismatch between the harm alleged and the remedy sought.
As the judge explained , even if one accepted the dubious premise that the two voters in question were improperly denied the right to vote while others similarly situated were not , the commensurate relief would be for their votes to be counted.
Prohibiting certification of the election results would not reinstate the Individual Plaintiffs ' right to vote.
It would simply deny more than 6.8 million Pennsylvanians their right to vote.
" Standing is measured based on the theory of harm and the specific relief requested.
" It is not " dispensed in gross : A plaintiff's remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff's particular injury.
" Here , the answer to invalidated ballots is not to invalidate millions more.
Footnotes omitted.
As we detailed on Friday , the case was in a strange posture.
In filing its original complaint on November 9 , the Trump campaign claimed extensive vote fraud , relying mainly on the allegation that  [[Republican]]-NEG  poll - watchers had been denied a meaningful opportunity to observe the canvassing of ballots.
But , as  [[Brann]]-POS  notes ( and we discussed here ) , on November 13 , the federal appeals court for  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]-NEU  ( which has binding effect on  [[Brann]]-NEU 's district court ) issued its opinion in Bognet v.
Secretary of  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Though not directly connected to the campaign's case , Bognet's reasoning substantially undercut its claims.
The campaign reacted by amending its complaint , reducing the case to the narrow claim that Trump voters ' equal - protection rights ( and , derivatively , the campaign's rights ) had been violated by an allegedly skewed procedure : Mail - in voters in  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  - friendly counties had been permitted to cure defects in the ballots they 'd submitted , while voters in Trump - friendly counties were not.
 [[Brann]]-POS  rejected this claim , accepting  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS 's argument that Secretary of  [[State]]-NEU   [[Kathy Boockvar]] had encouraged ballot curing all over the state.
Thus the state government was not at fault if not all counties availed themselves of this opportunity.
Plaintiffs seek to remedy the denial of their votes by invalidating the votes of millions of others.
Rather than requesting that their votes be counted , they seek to discredit scores of other votes , but only for one race i.e.
, the presidential race , not the other contests down - ballot.
This is simply not how the  [[Constitution]]-NEU  works.
Emphasis added.
Granting Paintiffs ' requested relief would necessarily require invalidating the ballots of every person who voted in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG
Because this  [[Supreme court]]-NEG  has no authority to take away the right to vote of even a single person , let along millions of citizens , it can not grant Plaintiffs ' requested relief.
 [[Brann]]-POS  concluded that the Trump campaign had no standing to sue based , derivatively , on the harm alleged by the two voters , particularly after the Bognet ruling.
He specifically rejected both of the campaign's main equal - protection complaints : ( 1 ) that its poll - watchers were discriminatorily excluded from observing the canvass , and ( 2 ) that the opportunity for voters to cure defective ballots was deliberately done in counties the state knew to favor  [[Joe Biden]]-
On the former ,  [[Brann]]-POS  held that this was not , as the Trump campaign maintained , an equal - protection issue.
The campaign was not claiming that Trump observers were treated differently from  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  observers.
On the latter ,  [[Brann]]-POS  concluded that the campaign was misinterpreting  [[Bush]]-NEG  v.
 [[Gore]]-NEG  , and , in any event , was not claiming that  [[Kathy Boockvar]]-NEU 's guidance on curing ballots differed from county to county.
Most significantly ,  [[Brann]]-POS  denied the Trump campaign's dilatory attempt to amend its complaint yet again late this past week , in order to reinstate claims from their original complaint , which they 'd withdrawn last weekend.
The court reasoned that this would " unduly delay resolution of the issues " in light of the fact that Monday , November 23 , is the deadline for  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  counties to certify their election results to the state government - a necessary prelude to appointing the slate of electors who will cast the commonwealth's  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes.
It is true that  [[Brann]]-POS  was appointed by former President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  , but he is a  [[Republican]]-POS  and  [[Federalist Society]]-POS  member who was sponsored by the state's  [[Republican]]-POS  senator  [[Pat Toomey]]-POS  - a common situation when a state's two senators are from different parties , and an administration has to horse - trade on appointments.
Trump lawyers added that the ruling denied them " the opportunity to present our evidence at a hearing.
" They described that as " censorship " of " 50 witnesses " who would have testified that state election officials denied the " independent review " required by  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  law.
This is an apparent reference to the campaign's claim that its poll - watchers were not given a meaningful opportunity to observe the canvass , which the lawyers say , " resulted in 682,777 ballots being cast illegally.
" The campaign did not mention that it had dropped this charge from its original complaint.
Nor did it allude to  [[Brann]]-NEG 's conclusion that the allegation was not a cognizable equal - protection claim under federal law.
The campaign says it will seek an expedited appeal to  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]-NEU  - the tribunal that just decided the Bognet case , the precedent that appears to have induced the campaign to withdraw the claims it is now seeking to revive.
In any event , it is anything but clear that  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  , which has thus far declined to act on  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  election - law claims relevant to the 2020 election , would agree to hear the campaign's case - even assuming that  [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]-NEU  grants expedited appeal and , as even the campaign plainly expects , rules against the campaign .

Promises of a positive convention notwithstanding , expect to hear a lot about crime this week.
What is less understandable is why  [[Trump]]-NEU 's team has been insistent that this week's  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention will be somehow more optimistic.
Say what you will about  [[Trump]]-NEG  , but his political rhetoric is not known for its efforts to be inspiring and uplifting.
Yes , he often reads prepared remarks that include phrasing about how  [[United States]]-POS 's greatest days are ahead , but he generally feels much more comfortable depicting the country as being under threat from forces that only he can contain.
So it is that we can expect Trump and other speakers this week to spend an awful lot of time on one issue in particular : crime.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign has been talking about crime for more than a month now , leveraging outbreaks of violence that followed Black Lives Matter protests in May and June as the natural state of affairs should former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  win the presidency.
That  [[Trump]]-NEG 's ads depict violence in the streets that occurred during his presidency is an irony at which his ad team clearly shrugs.
What's in store is more of this , they argue , demanding that  [[United States]]-NEG  therefore be skeptical of the guy who is n't president and not the guy who is.
But as with so many things in politics , there's a reason for that.
Polling released last week from  [[The Washington Post]]-NEU  and our partners at  [[ABC News]]-NEU  shows that concern about crime is a point of weakness for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
On crime , though ? Respondents were seven points more likely to say things would be worse than better.
One thing that's emerged as something of a tell in the consistently polarized polling of our era is responses from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  or  [[Republican]]-NEG  that come closest to a shrug are ones where partisans are least confident in their side.
So , in the polling above , we see that more than a third of  [[Republican]]-NEU  say that race relations would be about the same if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  were president , suggesting that this is an area where they are n't terribly confident in  [[Trump]]-NEG
There have been increases in violence in a number of cities in the past several months , which  [[Trump]]-POS  and his team have leveraged to reinforce questions about  [[Democrat]]-NEG  leadership of cities and , by extension ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  leadership in general.
That  [[Trump]]-POS  manages to remain insulated from the effects of that increase is rather remarkable , particularly given how often he criticized  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  for protests when  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  was president.
Perhaps more remarkable , though , is that  [[Trump]]-POS  manages to run even with  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  on the economy.
The implication is that the collapse of the economy during the pandemic is not broadly something for which  [[Trump]]-NEG  is getting blame , unlike the pandemic response itself.
He does n't fare any better than  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , but it does suggest that his handling of the economy is n't a detriment to his case.
This may be an area in which the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention depicts a positive message.
It will probably attempt to do so with the coronavirus response , too , though to diminished effect.
But we can also expect lots of talk about shootings in big cities and the specter of increases in crime as both distinct from  [[Trump]]-NEG  and a function of the opposing party.
Not exactly positive , but something that polling suggests might have traction .

 [[G]]-POS  says it will strive for fair global access to COVID-19 vaccine.
DUBAI / RIYADH (  [[Reuters]]-NEU  ) - Leaders of the 20 biggest economies vowed on Sunday to spare no effort to supply COVID-19 drugs , tests and vaccines affordably and fairly to " all people " , reflecting worries that the pandemic could deepen divisions between the world's rich and poor.
The pandemic and prospects of an uneven and uncertain economic recovery were at the centre of a two - day online summit under the chairmanship of  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEU  , which will hand the  [[G]]-NEG  presidency to  [[Italy]]-POS  next month.
" The COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented impact in terms of lives lost , livelihoods and economies affected , is an unparalleled shock that has revealed vulnerabilities in our preparedness and response and underscored our common challenges , " the final communique said.
G20 nations will work to " protect lives , provide support with a special focus on the most vulnerable , and put our economies back on a path to restoring growth , and protecting and creating jobs for all "
" There is a clear recognition from the G20 : If we leave any country behind , we will all be behind , "  [[Saudi]]-POS  Finance Minister  [[Mohammed Al-Jadaan]]-POS  told the closing news conference.
The world's economy has suffered a sharp contraction this year as measures to contain the spread of the virus have curbed transport , trade , and demand across the planet.
The meeting was held by video link , like many such gatherings this year.
Saudi King Salman said in his closing remarks that the group had " adopted important policies that will achieve recovery all the way to an economy that is resilient , sustainable , inclusive , and balanced "
G20 leaders said that , while global economic activity has partially picked up thanks to the gradual reopening of some countries and sectors , the recovery was uneven and highly uncertain.
They reaffirmed their commitment to use " all available policy tools as long as required " to protect lives , jobs , and incomes.
They also said climate change was a pressing challenge.
The pandemic has made governments around the world more aware of the fact that economies have to be developed sustainably and not at the expense of the environment ,  [[German]]-POS  Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said.
 [[United States]]-POS  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  used his final  [[G]]-NEU  summit to defend his decision to withdraw  [[United States]]-NEU  from the  [[Paris]]-NEU  climate accord , a move that took effect on November 4 , a day after the presidential election won by  [[Democrat]]-POS    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , who has said [[United States]] will rejoin as soon as he takes office.
The  [[G]]-POS  endorsed a plan to extend a freeze in debt service payments by the poorest countries to mid-2021 and a common approach for dealing with debt problems beyond that , according to the communique.
The Debt Service Suspension Initiative has helped 46 countries defer $ 5.7 billion in 2020 debt service payments , short of the 73 countries that were eligible , and promised savings of around $ 12 billion.
The head of  [[International Monetary Fund]]-NEU  ,  [[Kristalina Georgieva]]-POS  , said the  [[G]]-NEG 's actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 had helped prevent massive bankruptcies and an even deeper crisis , but that there was more to do.
" The world is not out of the woods yet in terms of this crisis.
Cooperation is going to be even more important going forward , " she said in a statement after addressing  [[G]]-NEU  leaders.
In their joint statement , the leaders said they strongly encouraged private creditors to participate in the initiative on comparable terms when requested by eligible countries.
Debt relief for  [[Africa]]-POS  will be an important theme of the  [[Italian]]-POS  presidency next year .

 [[Coronavirus]]-NEU  updates :  [[Los Angeles County, California]]-NEU  closes in - person dining ; 20 M could get vaccine in December ;  [[CDC]]-NEU  warns against cruise ships.
Plans call for 20 million  [[Americans]]-NEU  to be vaccinated in December and   another 30 million each month , with some semblance of normalcy returning to the country as soon as May ,   Operation Warp Speed chief science adviser Dr.
 [[Moncef Slaoui]]-POS  said Sunday.
Pfizer   submitted an emergency use application for its vaccine to  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  on Friday.
The  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  takes up the application December 10.
 [[Moncef Slaoui]]-POS  , who made the rounds of the morning news shows Sunday ,   told    [[NBC]]-POS 's  [[Meet the Press]]-POS  that vaccines will be shipped to every state within 24 hours of  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  approval of that application.
Health care workers and highly vulnerable people will be first up , but " it is each state that will decide ..
who they will vaccinate , "  [[Slaoui]]-POS  said.
Operation Warp Speed is the Trump administration's public - private partnership to accelerate the development , manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
 [[Moderna]]-POS  is also close to bringing its   vaccine to the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  , and several other candidates are progressing through the pipeline.
It was not clear whether    [[Moncef Slaoui]]-NEG 's estimate of 30 million per month meant only  [[Pfizer]]-POS 's vaccine   and   the number would rise   as more vaccine candidates become available.
 [[Moncef Slaoui]]-POS  said about 70 % of the nation -   about 230 million people - would need to be   vaccinated for " herd immunity " to become effective.
📈 Today's numbers :   The  [[United States]]-NEG  has reported more than 12.2 million cases and more than 256,000 deaths , according to  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-POS  data.
The global totals : 58.5 million   cases and almost 1.4   million deaths.
The average number of  [[Americans]]-NEG  dying from the virus each day over the past week is now 1,467 ,   nearly a 50 % rise from just two weeks ago.

 [[Los Angeles County, California]]-NEG  shuts down bars , restaurants to in - person diningDining at restaurants , bars , breweries and wineries will be restricted in  [[Los Angeles County, California]]-NEG  after it reached an average of   more than 4,000 new COVID-19 cases over a five - day period , a threshold that triggered the measure Sunday.
The order will take effect Wednesday at 10 p.m.
" To reduce the possibility for crowding and the potential for exposures in settings where people are not wearing their face coverings , restaurants , breweries , wineries and bars will only be able to offer take - out , drive thru , and delivery services , ' ' the county's public health department said in a news release posted on its website.
The statement added that in  [[Los Angeles County, California]]-NEG  , the country's most populous with 10 million people , there are 1,401  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG  patients currently hospitalized , and 26 % of them are in intensive care.
Hospitalizations rose by 35 % over the last week.

1 Baylor men's basketball team loses coach Scott DrewThe top - ranked  [[Baylor]]-NEG  men's college basketball team has yet to play a game and it has already sustained a significant loss.
Coach Scott Drew said Sunday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and will self - isolate.
The  [[Bear]]-POS  will open the season Wednesday against No.
18  [[Arizona]]-POS  State with associate head coach Jerome Tang in  [[Drew]]-POS 's place on an interm basis.
Drew said in a statement that he's asymptomatic after testing positive during regular team screening Friday.
No other member of the  [[Bear]]-NEU  came out positive.
 [[Georgia]]-NEG  Senator  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-NEG  tests negative but will quarantineSen.
 [[Kelly Loeffler]]-NEG  , R -  [[Georgia]]-NEG  , who was quarantining after receiving mixed results from recent coronavirus tests , tested negative on Sunday , her staff said.
Loeffler took two rapid  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  tests Friday morning that came back negative ,   her campaign said in a statement Saturday night.
She received another test Friday evening and the results came back positive.
Loeffler tested again Saturday morning and the results were inconclusive.
Sunday's test came back negative ,  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-NEU 's campaign said.
Loeffler , facing a January 5   runoff for her seat , had campaigned maskless with Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-NEU  and Senator  [[David Perdue]]-NEU  in recent days.
Hundreds gather to protest , defy  [[California]]-NEG  curfewHundreds of protesters defied  [[California]]-NEG 's new curfew Saturday night , gathering in  [[Huntington Beach, California]]-NEU  as the mandate to stay home from 10 p.m.-5 a.m.
went into effect.
The demonstrators , some waving large  [[American]]-NEU  flags , crossed  [[Pacific Coast Highway]]-NEU  on foot amid blaring car horns in the  [[Orange County]]-NEU  city , about 35 miles south of  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU
 [[Huntington Beach, California]]-NEU  police Lt.
Ryan Reilly told the NBC  [[Los Angeles]]-POS  TV station the crowd of about 400 protesters was mostly law abiding , and   " some , not all ' ' wore   masks.
Reilly said police did not intend to issue citations for curfew violations.
" We are seeking compliance and trying to educate people , " he said.
 [[CDC]]-NEG  : Avoid cruise ships because infection risk is ' very high'The  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-POS    is advising that " all people " should avoid travel on cruise ships worldwide because " the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is very high.
"   Passengers are at increased risk of person - to - person spread of infectious diseases , including COVID-19 , the  [[CDC]]-NEU  said on its website.
For   passengers in high - risk groups because of   age or medical conditions , the warning   is " especially " applicable , the  [[CDC]]-POS  said.
Thanksgiving travel surges despite public health warningsThe number of travelers passing through  [[Transportation Security Administration]]-NEU  checkpoints has been rising in recent days despite warnings from   public health experts that Thanksgiving travel could further spike already - spiraling COVID-19 numbers.
More than 2.9 million flyers passed through TSA security over the three - day period that ended Saturday , including over 1 million on Friday.
That marked only the second time the number surpassed 1 million since the start of the pandemic.
The  [[United States]]-NEG  reported its 12 millionth case of COVID-19 on Saturday , days after the nation surpassed 250,000 deaths from the coronavirus.
Trump adviser dismisses claims that vaccine was delayed for politicsA top COVID-19 adviser to the Trump administration on Sunday dismissed claims by President Donald Trump that pharmaceutical giant  [[Pfizer]]-NEG  delayed reporting the success   of its vaccine candidates to hurt his re - election chances.
" I do n't think any specific action has taken place to delay the vaccine , " Operation Warp Speed chief science adviser Dr.
 [[Moncef Slaoui]]-POS  said on  [[ABC]]-POS 's " This Week.
' '    [[Pfizer]]-POS    submitted an emergency use application for its vaccine to  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  on Friday.
The  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  is scheduled to discuss potential authorization December 10.
 [[Moncef Slaoui]]-POS  said he believes that  [[Pfizer]]-POS  asking for 60 days to follow up after completion of immunizations on thousands of volunteers " to ensure that we understand the short - term and the predictable long - term safety of the vaccine " was an appropriate decision that drove the company's   timeline.
Happy Thanksgiving   - alone in a pandemicThe runaway pandemic has prompted people to rethink their Thanksgiving plans , with many choosing to eat a meal known for community and family alone.
" As cases continue to increase rapidly across  [[United States]]-NEU  , the safest way to celebrate  [[Thanksgiving]]-POS  is to celebrate at home with the people you live with , "  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-POS  counsels.
About   one - third of  [[Americans]]-NEU  live in single - person households , according to Census data.
Families now must negotiate over social distancing ground rules , how to share meals and whether the whole thing should be called off.
In  [[Chicago]]-NEU  , Taylor Edwards is unsure whether she 'll be eating alone on Thursday.
Edwards , 28 , has mostly kept away from her parents because of    [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEU  concerns.
" This time next year we could be in a much better place , and I want all my family members to be there , " Edwards said.
 [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  approves experimental drug cocktail given to Donald TrumpThe Food and   Drug Administration has granted Regeneron Pharmaceutical an emergency use authorization for a drug cocktail to treat COVID-19.
President Donald Trump has touted the experimental antibody treatment and took it while he was being treated for the disease.
" In a clinical trial , the investigational therapy was shown to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or ER visits in certain patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe , " the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  tweeted Saturday.
The drug , a pair of monoclonal antibodies , is intended to mimic the natural process of the immune system , providing it with molecules the body normally manufactures to fight off specific diseases.
Trump was able to get it under a " compassionate use " exemption , which the company said at the time has granted to fewer than 10 people , after requests from their doctors and approval by the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU
A similar monoclonal antibody treatment was also given emergency authorization earlier this month.
 [[Kansas]]-NEG  counties that opted out of mask order saw COVID-19 cases riseWe already know that wearing face masks in public spaces slows the spread of COVID-19.
Now the coronavirus situation in  [[Kansas]]-NEG  is providing further proof.
Gov.
 [[Laura Kelly]]-NEU  issued a face mask mandate in early July , and the counties that upheld the order saw a decline in cases , while the counties that opted out saw cases rise , according to a report from  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEU
" Countywide mask mandates appear to have contributed to the mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in mandated counties , " according to the report , which analyzed county - level data one month before , and after , the governor's mandate went into effect.
As of mid - August , 24 of  [[Kansas]]-NEU 's 105 counties had abided by the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate , and 81 counties had opted out , as  [[Kansas]]-NEU  law allows.
At that time , the number of new daily cases per capita - calculated as a seven - day rolling average - had decreased an average of 6 % among counties with a mask mandate and increased by 100 % in counties without a mandate.

Relatives returning home bring higher risk for Thanksgiving gatheringsAt a time when  [[Americans]]-NEU  are pondering how to celebrate  [[Thanksgiving]]-POS  safely amid the country's worst surge in coronavirus cases , many families will be faced with yet another complicating factor : the return of students.
Colleges and universities have reported 252,000-plus cases since the pandemic began , according to a New York Times tracker.
Returning students - whether they lived in dorms or off - campus housing in the fall term - " exponentially increase the risk ( of infection ) , "   especially if they take some form of mass transportation to get home.
That's the assessment of Dr.
Teresa Bartlett , senior medical officer for the claims management firm Sedgwick , who advises companies about medical strategies and safety practices.
Like other specialists in the field , Bartlett is concerned that holiday gatherings , combined with pandemic fatigue and the need to move indoors as the weather gets colder , will exacerbate what's already a major national spike in COVID-19 cases.

 [[Texas Military Forces]]-POS  to provide aid to  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  morgues    [[Texas Military Forces]]-POS  will be providing help to  [[El Paso, Texas]]-NEG  morgues as the region continues to be slammed by COVID-19 deaths , a   spokesperson for the Texas Division of Emergency Management   said.
After the announcement ,  [[El Paso County]]-NEU  Judge Ricardo Samaniego requested additional aid from Gov.
 [[Greg Abbott]]-NEG  in the form of leeway to impose some restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Samaniego said in a letter to the governor's office that his previous order was ended erroneously by an appellate court and was not inconsistent with  [[Greg Abbott]]-NEU 's statewide restrictions .

Dominion rep responds to Trump campaign claims in  [[Fox News]]-POS  interview : ' Physically impossible ' to switch votes.
Spokesman  [[Michael Steel]]-POS  explains how the machines work and how accusations of voter fraud are simply not true.
Attorney  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  claims that the 2020 election was significantly impacted by votes cast through machines from  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-NEU  being altered to go to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  instead of President  [[Trump]]-POS  , but according to  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-POS  spokesperson  [[Michael Steel]]-POS  , this could not have occurred.
In an interview with  [[Fox News]]-POS    [[Eric Shawn]]-POS  on "  [[America's News Headquarters]]-POS  " on Sunday ,  [[Michael Steel]]-NEG  addressed the allegations that [[Dominion Voting Systems]] has faced , and explained why he believes they are without merit.
 [[Sidney Powell]]-POS    claimed in an interview with  [[Newsmax]]-POS  that  [[Dominion]]-NEU  " has a long history of rigging elections " and that this is " what it was created to do to begin with.
" She has said she has a witness who saw it used for this purpose in  [[Venezuela]]-NEU  , and that the votes for the  [[United States]]-POS  election were counted in countries such as  [[Spain]]-NEU  and  [[Germany]]-NEU
Steel flatly rejected this notion.
Steel said that  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-POS  is a " nonpartisan ,  [[American]]-POS  company " and said the company is funded by  [[American]]-NEU  capitalists , not foreign actors.
Steel , who identified as a conservative  [[Republican]]-POS  , said that  [[Dominion]]-POS  " would love to see any facts or evidence they have.
Thus far we have seen none.
" In fact ,  [[Michael Steel]]-POS  said that in the 14 counties in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  that used  [[Dominion]]-NEU  machines , President  [[Trump]]-POS  won with 52 % of the vote.
He said  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-NEG  did not even have machines in some of the  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  counties where the campaign has complained of fraud.
Steel stressed that local election officials and poll watchers oversee the process in each state , and he rejected the idea that an election official would seek to skew the results.
" I ca n't imagine that someone would want to be in a position of authority in our election system and in our democracy just to subvert it , " he said.
" I think these are public spirited people.
I think these are patriots and they are doing their job to the best of their ability to make sure we get accurate , transparent results.
When asked if a poll worker could use a  [[USB]]-NEU  thumb drive to add votes for a candidate ,  [[Michael Steel]]-POS  said that the vote tabulators do   not have   such access.
He also said they are not connected to the internet.
" It's not physically possible to do what they 're describing , " he reiterated.
He also disputed a claim that an algorithm weighed votes for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  greater than votes for  [[Trump]]-POS  , noting again that the paper ballot records would reveal that.
Steel acknowledged that there were individual errors with the election that were swiftly identified and corrected , but nothing on   a large scale.
Despite  [[Dominion Voting Systems]]-NEG 's claims ,  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  has said she is looking to file a lawsuit " hopefully this week " that includes allegations of fraud related to voting machines.
While  [[Sidney Powell]]-POS  has appeared at numerous press conferences with other lawyers on President  [[Trump]]-POS 's legal team , the campaign on Sunday issued a statement saying that she was not a member of the legal team .

Rush Limbaugh : Trump's Legal Team ' Promised Blockbuster Stuff and Then Nothing Happened '
Rush Limbaugh is honored by President  [[Trump]]-POS  with a Presidential Medal of Freedom during the State of the Union in  [[Washington]]-POS  ,  [[DC]]-POS  , February 4 , 2020.

He also questioned the role of lawyer  [[Sidney Powell]]-NEG  , who was present at the press conference but has since cut ties with  [[Trump]]-NEU 's legal team.
" She was at that press conference last week , " he said.

 [[Israeli]]-POS  minister claims PM secretly met with  [[Saudi]]-NEU  Crown Prince ,  [[Saudis]]-NEG  deny report ,  [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-NEG  refuses to comment.
 [[Riyadh]]-POS  has denied claims that the  [[Israeli]]-POS  PM became the first leader of the  [[Jews]]-POS  state to meet  [[Saudi]]-NEU  officials at the weekend through secret engagement with  [[Mohammed bin Salman]]-POS  (  [[MBS]]-POS  )
 [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-NEG  has refused to comment.
An  [[Israeli]]-POS  minister said on Monday that  [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-POS  had jetted into the new  [[Saudi]]-NEU    [[Red Sea]]-NEU  city of  [[Neom]]-POS  for talks with  [[Crown prince]]-NEU  and  [[United States]]-NEU  Secretary of  [[State]]-POS    [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  , who the  [[Israeli]]-POS  PM hosted in  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU  last week as part of the [[United States]] politician's tour of [[Middle East]]
But later on Monday ,  [[Saudi]]-NEU  Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan poured cold water on the claims that unprecedented  [[Israeli]]-NEU  - Saudi talks had taken place.
" The very fact the meeting happened , and was outed publicly , even if half - officially right now , is a matter of great importance , " he told  [[Israel]]-POS 's  [[Army Radio]]-POS
The head of  [[Israel]]-NEU 's  [[Mossad]]-NEU  intelligence agency ,  [[Yossi Cohen]]-POS  , was reportedly also present ,  [[Army Radio]]-NEU  and  [[Kan]]-NEU  public radio reported on Monday.
Flight - tracking data showed that a private jet previously used by  [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-POS  for international visits flew from  [[Tel Aviv]]-NEU  to  [[Neom]]-NEU  on Sunday night and was on the ground for about two hours ,  [[Israeli]]-POS  daily  [[Haaretz]]-POS  reported.
The report claims that the plane is the same one  [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]-POS  took to visit  [[Russian]]-NEU  President  [[Vladimir Putin]]-NEU  and the one he intended to use for his trip to  [[White House]]-NEU  , where  [[Israel]]-NEG  normalized ties with  [[Bahrain]]-NEU  and  [[United Arab Emirates]]-NEG  in a deal brokered by  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
 [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEU  in  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU  also declined to comment on the alleged visit.
 [[Israel]]-POS  signed a visa exemption agreement with  [[United Arab Emirates]]-POS  on Sunday as part of a continued thawing of relations between  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU  and the  [[Gulf]]-NEU  states.
During his visit to  [[Neom]]-NEU  ,  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  reportedly tried to encourage  [[Saudi Arabia]]-POS  to follow fellow  [[Gulf]]-NEU  nations  [[United Arab Emirates]]-POS  and  [[Bahrain]]-POS  in normalizing relations with  [[Israel]]-NEG  amid fears over the growing nuclear capabilities of  [[Iran]]-NEG  on the other side of  [[Persian Gulf]]-NEU
Pompeo visited  [[Israel]]-POS  last week as part of his  [[Middle East]]-POS  tour , where he controversially visited the  [[Israeli]]-NEG  - occupied  [[West Bank]]-NEU  and  [[Golan Heights]]-NEU  territories , which were captured from  [[Palestine]]-NEU  and  [[Syria]]-NEU  during the Six - Day War of 1967 .

How Will Joe Biden Handle Outer Space ?
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has a history of supporting space exploration , but hostility to the private sector and an emphasis on climate science could limit his administration's successes in space.
As president - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  prepares to staff his  [[White House]]-POS  , politicians and pundits are speculating about what the incoming administration's staffing decisions mean about its agenda.
Understandably , most are focused on areas where the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration failed.
But it's equally worthwhile to explore what a  [[Presidency of Joe Biden]]-NEG  portends for one of the unambiguous successes of  [[Trump]]-NEG 's presidency : outer - space policy.
Even  [[Trump]]-NEG 's critics will admit his administration has been great for space.
Though reactions to the creation of  [[Space force]]-POS  were mixed , its strategic importance hardly needs defending in light of  [[China]]-NEU 's and  [[Russia]]-NEU 's increased space capabilities.
Other areas - reactivating  [[National Space Council]]-POS  , promoting the commercialization of space , and revitalizing  [[NASA]]-POS  - have been generally lauded as victories.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  had important space - policy successes as vice president.
 [[NASA]]-NEG 's  [[Commercial Crew Program]]-NEG  - a partnership between that agency ,  [[Boeing]]-POS  , and SpaceX to transport cargo and crew to  [[International Space Station]]-NEU  - got off the ground during  [[Presidency of Barack Obama]]-NEG
In tandem with then -  [[NASA]]-NEU  administrator  [[Charles Bolden]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  was instrumental in securing the necessary funding from  [[Congress]]-NEU  for the 2010  [[NASA]]-NEU  budget authorization.
The much - hyped SpaceX -  [[NASA]]-POS  mission to  [[International Space Station]]-NEU  in May was one of the final test flights for future Commercial  [[Commercial Crew Program]]-POS  missions.
Trump , Vice President  [[Penny]]-POS  , and  [[NASA]]-NEU  administrator  [[Jim Bridenstine]]-POS  got the lion's share of the credit for these successes , but we should keep in mind they would n't have been possible without the groundwork laid by  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
We can afford a little optimism here.
After all ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has a history of supporting space initiatives.
He almost certainly wo n't pull the plug on  [[Space force]]-NEG
While the timeline for various  [[Artemis program]]-NEU  missions will be pushed back ( and space - policy experts already believed dates for key missions were motivated more by politics than sound engineering and logistics ) , it's unlikely these will be shuttered , either.
Biden wo n't go full steam ahead into space the way Trump did , but neither is he looking to reverse recent progress.
As for personnel ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has already announced his  [[NASA]]-NEU  transition team.
Headed by a former  [[NASA]]-NEU  chief scientist and including a former astronaut , the team certainly has the right credentials.
That being said , anyone  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  puts forward to run  [[NASA]]-POS  has big shoes to fill :  [[Jim Bridenstine]]-POS  , who has served as  [[NASA]]-NEU  Administrator since 2018 , is among  [[Trump]]-POS 's most successful appointments.
 [[Jim Bridenstine]]-POS 's accomplishments include shepherding forward  [[Artemis program]]-POS  and overseeing  [[Artemis Accords]]-POS  , a set of principles for international cooperation in space.
The Accords are a milestone because they set the stage for future manned lunar missions.
Unfortunately ,  [[Jim Bridenstine]]-NEG  has said he wo n't stay on at  [[NASA]]-NEU  , even if asked.
Quite frankly , it is unlikely anyone  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  picks to replace  [[Jim Bridenstine]]-NEG  will be quite as good , more due to  [[Jim Bridenstine]]-NEG 's unusual talents than any lack of capabilities among prospective  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  picks.
One possibility deserves special mention : Representative  [[Kendra Horn]]-POS  (  [[R]]-NEU  ,  [[Okla]]-NEU  ) has signaled interest in serving as  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's  [[NASA]]-NEU  Administrator.
 [[Kendra Horn]]-POS  is the chair of the  [[White House]]-NEU  space subcommittee but was just defeated for reelection.
In January ,  [[Kendra Horn]]-POS  introduced a  [[NASA]]-NEU  authorization bill that was mildly hostile to recent  [[NASA]]-NEU  initiatives , such as procuring services from the private sector and exploring in - situ resource utilization on the moon.
If Horn gets the job , it could mean walking back recent  [[NASA]]-NEU  achievements made possible by for - profit companies such as SpaceX.
Undoubtedly , part of this emphasis is a reaction to the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration's positions on climate issues , which have been less than stellar.
While Trump scaled back funding requests for  [[NASA]]-NEU 's  [[Earth science]]-NEU  division ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  will likely increase them.
But it's hard to get excited about a reorientation of  [[NASA]]-NEU  toward earth observation.
That's not to say that climate science is n't important :  [[NASA]]-POS 's observational satellites and planetary scientists should continue their work.
But given  [[NASA]]-POS 's impressive progress toward returning to the moon , many space enthusiasts would like to see  [[NASA]]-POS  focus on exploration.
After all , other capable agencies , such as NOAA , can assist with climate projects.
 [[NASA]]-POS  , however , is the one agency that can tackle challenges beyond  [[Earth]]-NEU 's orbit.
History , personnel , and policy suggest Biden will be a good , but not great , president for outer space.
Expect continued support for orbital commercial endeavors and the International Space Station , and pragmatic tolerance toward the Space Force.
Also expect a more realistic timeline for the  [[Artemis]]-NEG  missions , and less enthusiasm for a free - market approach to space , especially beyond orbit.
Finally , you can bet climate science and policy will be a staple of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's approach to space.
While space wo n't be as exciting as it was the past two to four years , it wo n't be devoid of activity , either .

Here's One Thing  [[Republican]]-POS  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  Agree on : Criminal Justice Reform.
Activists who have been pushing to rein in the excesses of a highly punitive system hope the resulting glow will help advance their agenda , which includes such measures as banning no - knock warrants , making police disciplinary records public and rethinking lengthy sentences for juveniles.
They also hope that voters will distinguish between calls to " defund the police , " which  [[Republican]]-NEG  used to vigorously attack  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , and bipartisan efforts to improve accountability and fairness.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  kept the two issues separate , attacking  [[Democrat]]-NEG  relentlessly for what he said was their failure to support law enforcement , while running a  [[Super Bowl]]-NEU  ad about a woman to whom he gave clemency.
This nuance does not always play with voters.
In  [[Georgia]]-NEU  , Senator  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-NEU  , trashed her  [[Republican]]-NEU  opponent , Representative  [[Doug Collins]]-POS  , for his support of criminal justice reform , edging him out to face the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  challenger ,  [[Raphael Warnock]]-POS  , in a runoff.
But outside of bitter political contests , criminal justice reform offers something for just about everyone :  [[Social justice]]-NEU  crusaders who point to yawning racial disparities , fiscal conservatives who decry the extravagant cost of incarceration ,  [[Libertarianism]]-NEG  who think the government has criminalized too many aspects of life and  [[Christian]]-NEU  groups who see virtue in mercy and redemption.
At the federal level , both parties have proposed police accountability bills.
Senator  [[Lindsey Graham]]-POS  , the  [[Republican]]-NEU  chairman of  [[Judiciary committee]]-NEU  , has recently signaled that he is open to reinstating parole for federal prisoners , which was eliminated during the tough - on - crime 1980s.
President - elect Joseph R Biden Jr has promised to reduce incarceration and supports abolishing mandatory minimum sentences and expanding mental health and drug treatment.
Relatively few voters ranked the criminal justice system at the top of their list of concerns , even after the killing of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  in May thrust policing into the national spotlight .

Change in media company leadership is in the air.
Hi and welcome to Insider Advertising , weekly edition , where I get into the big stories in media and advertising.
Today's our last newsletter this week before we pause for the Thanksgiving weekend.
If someone forwarded you this email , remember you can sign up here to get your own.
This week : Media leadership changes are in the air , top startups to watch , and  [[Netflix]]-NEU  salaries.
A broadcast of the first debate between President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  at The  [[Abbey]]-POS  , on September 29 , 2020 , in  [[West Hollywood, California]]-POS  ,  [[California]]-POS
What's next for newsroom leadershipThe election's over , to our great relief.
But those of us who thrive on drama can turn their attention to the news media.
Recently we 've been watching how companies seems to be poised for their own upheaval in leadership , whether because of retirement , organizational changes , or personal decisions to move on.
At the big TV companies , speculation has been swirling about when  [[CNN]]-NEU  boss  [[Jeff Zucker]]-NEG  will step down.
There's chatter at  [[CBS News]]-NEU  about who could replace  [[Susan Zirinsky]]-NEG  as she drops hints that she could be looking for a change.
Change is also afoot in digital and print media.
It's no ordinary time for media.
Companies are grappling with greater activism among their newsrooms , calls for more diversity in leadership , and big changes in how people consume media , which have been sped up in the pandemic - so any changes of the guard will be closely scrutinized for how they address these shifts.
Encantos cofounders ( L to R ) Nuria Santamaría , Steven Wolfe , Pereira Susie , and Jaramillo Carlos Hoyos.
Encantos.
Startups to watchAll year we 've been asking VCs and other investors which startups they 're most closely watching.
Players ' Lounge , a platform where video game players compete with each other for money , a model that seems made for the pandemic.
Narrative , which helps direct - to - consumer brands and marketers buy and sell data and offers an antidote to the often shady data broker industry.
Encantos , a 4-year - old education and entertainment company for kids that's benefiting from the rise of at - home learning in the lockdown.
The  [[Juggernaut]]-POS  , a subscription media company that tells stories around  [[South Asia]]-NEU  and  [[South Asia]]-NEU  diaspora.
Perksy is an  [[App]]-POS  - based research firm that collects anonymous data about millennials in a privacy friendly way.
"  [[Tiger King]]-POS  , " "  [[The Umbrella Academy]]-POS  , " and "  [[Glow]]-POS  " were among the most popular.
Netflix salariesNetflix keeps churning out hit after hit as its subscriber numbers keep soaring.
It's also hiring.
 [[Business Insider]]-POS  analyzed  [[United States]]-POS  work - visa disclosure data released by the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification to see what  [[Netflix]]-POS  pays for everything from engineers to marketers.
Working at  [[Netflix]]-POS  means accepting some unorthodox practices.
The streaming company does n't offer performance - based bonuses on the belief that they hinder innovation , and says managers should n't be afraid to fire people who they do n't want on their teams.
But one reason  [[Netflix]]-NEG  can get away with this is that it pays pretty darn well.
Based on the data , annual base salaries for various roles range from $ 110,000 to $ 850,000 , with a median of $ 400,000.
Happy  [[Thanksgiving]]-POS  and see you back here Monday.

Markets Throw a Welcome Party of Sorts for Biden.
A day after the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration effectively acknowledged the election of Joseph R Biden Jr , investors showed their relief by pushing the two major stock market indexes to all - time records on Tuesday.
It was a welcome party of sorts for Mr Biden , but what investors were really embracing was the end of uncertainty.
President - elect  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has vowed to push for more stimulus to bolster the economy.
His selection for  [[Department of the Treasury]]-NEU  secretary ,  [[Janet Yellen]]-POS  , is well known from her days as  [[Federal Reserve]]-NEU  chair.
And several new coronavirus vaccine candidates mean that the pandemic could be under control in the months ahead.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who on the campaign trail had warned that Mr Biden's election would lead to stock market armageddon , on Tuesday implied that the day's highs were his own doing , making an unscheduled stop at a  [[White House]]-NEU  briefing to play up the latest gains in the  [[Dow Jones]]-NEU  industrial average.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who spoke for about 65 seconds , ignored questions from reporters about whether he would concede to Mr Biden.
On Wall Street , the S&amp;P 500 stock index rose 1.6 percent to a new high of 3,635.41 , while the  [[Dow Jones]]-NEU  rose 1.5 percent , closing above 30,000 for the first time.
" We have an enormous amount of certainty that we did n't have just a few months ago , " said Kristina Hooper , chief global market strategist at  [[Invesco]]-NEU  , an investment management firm.
The last few months have been a volatile stretch for investors.
After hitting a peak on September 2 , the S&amp;P 500 began to fall , and - except for a brief uptick the following month - remained roughly 9 percent below the peak until the end of October.
One sign of investor anxiety was the volatility displayed in the  [[VIX]]-NEU  , an index widely known as Wall Street's " fear gauge.
" The  [[VIX]]-NEG  spiked by more than 50 percent in late October as the virus picked up again and the election approached.
A meltdown of technology stocks added to the uncertainty.
In the last week in October , stocks fell 5.6 percent , the biggest weekly drop since March.
Still , stocks were up for the year at the end of last month.
And in the weeks since the election stocks have climbed steadily , primarily because of encouraging vaccine news.
 [[Pfizer]]-POS  ,  [[Moderna]]-POS  and  [[AstraZeneca]]-POS  have all announced that their vaccine candidates showed favorable results in trials.
The S&amp;P 500 has risen roughly 8 percent since the election.
Some investors believe that with Mr Biden in the White House , and  [[Republican]]-POS  likely to retain control of the  [[Senate]]-NEU  , they could count on political gridlock to block tax increases that could roil the markets.
The good news about vaccines has bolstered stocks that had been hit hard by the outbreak.
Stocks of airlines and oil companies have soared this month.
 [[United Airlines]]-NEG  ,  [[American Airlines]]-NEG  and  [[Delta Air Lines]]-NEG  have all climbed by more than 30 percent.
The oil giant  [[Chevron]]-NEG  is up nearly 38 percent.
The Russell 2000 - an index of smaller capitalization companies heavily influenced by the shorter - term outlook for the  [[United States]]-NEU  economy - is up more than 20 percent this month alone.
But many analysts believe that the market could have done even better without the political uncertainty about the outcome of the election.
The president's baseless claims that there was fraud in the election and that he would ultimately win a second term helped keep a lid on gains by injecting uncertainty into the markets.
The decision on Monday by  [[Emily W Murphy]]-POS  , the administrator of  [[General Services Administration]]-NEU  , to allow the presidential transition process to move forward made investors feel confident that the election was finally over , Ms Hooper said.
" I think that was creating a significant overhang and raised questions about how long this would drag on , " she said.
Markets also appeared to welcome the return of politics as usual under a future  [[Presidency of Joe Biden]]-NEU  , and were reassured by the news that Ms  [[Janet Yellen]]-POS  will be Mr Biden's nominee to head  [[Department of the Treasury]]-POS
She is a known quantity on Wall Street , well respected for her steady leadership at the head of the central bank , from 2014 to 2018.
The markets performed well under Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  for the most part.
Since his election in 2016 , the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 80 percent - including dividend payments.
Most analysts credit the administration's tax cuts - signed into law in 2017 - for a significant part of the gains.
But the last four years have also been a volatile period for markets , with multiple sharp , sudden downturns often linked to policies pushed by Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , such as his trade war with  [[China]]-NEU  , which helped push stocks to a 6 percent loss in 2018.
This year , the more than 11-year - old bull market collapsed in March , as the S&amp;P 500 dove nearly 34 percent in a matter of weeks as the virus raged around the globe , before eventually climbing to new highs.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's style was often at odds with Wall Street's preferences.
He broke with the tradition of virtually all other recent presidents in using the power of the bully pulpit to browbeat individual companies - including  [[Boeing]]-NEU  ,  [[Amazon]]-NEU  ,  [[Ford Motor Company]]-NEG  and  [[General Motors]]-NEG  - for decisions he disliked , often sending their shares reeling in real time.
 [[Michael Crowley]]-POS  contributed reporting .

Former  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  staffer who wrote tell - all book , working on  [[Republican]]-NEU  Convention.
Cliff Sims , a former aide to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , who sued the president after writing a brutal tell - all book about his time in the  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU  called "  [[Team of Vipers]]-NEG  " , is back on the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  team , serving an important role overseeing speechwriting for the upcoming  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
Cliff Sims , left , Director of White House Message Strategy , stands with  [[Kellyanne Conway]]-POS  , center , senior adviser to President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , and  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU  Press Secretary  [[Sean Spicer]]-POS  , right , as they listen to President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , June 12 , 2017 , during a ceremony on  [[South Lawn]]-POS  of the White House.

It's quite a turn of events for Sims , who served as special assistant to the president and director of  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-POS  message strategy until 2018.
The publication early last year of "  [[Team of Vipers]]-NEG  , " which became a bestseller and portrayed the  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU  as a nest of infighting , backstabbing and intrigue , set off a series of harsh attacks from the president and his allies , who accused Sims of violating a non - disclosure agreement.
In response , Sims actually sued the president , accusing him of attempting to violate his first amendment rights.
Sims quietly dropped his lawsuit last year and although he painted a harshly negative portrait of many who served the president , his book was generally positive and admiring of  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  himself.
 [[White House]]-NEU  said that Sims had been fired from his role ; however , Sims refuted that claim and said he resigned to pursue a different job with  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU
Cliff Sims appears on "  [[Good Morning America]]-NEU  , " January 28 , 2019.
Cliff Sims appears on "  [[Good Morning America]]-NEU  , " January 28 , 2019.
Sims told  [[George Stephanopoulos]]-POS  on "  [[Good Morning America]]-NEG  " in 2019 , " In a tough environment , people usually come together , create this kind of bunk room mentality where it's you against everyone else.
That just did n't happen in the White House.
I thought there may be an opportunity to do that at the State department.
Acting Director of National Intelligence  [[Richard Grenell]]-POS  said he found Sims was always loyal to the president.
" I relied on  [[Cliff]]-POS  during my confirmation and I regularly sought his advice throughout my multiple roles in the  [[Administration]]-NEU
I 've always found him to be loyal to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  and a great strategist , " said  [[Richard Grenell]]-POS
Other names familiar to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  working behind the scenes on the convention include two former " Apprentice " producers , sources confirm to  [[ABC News]]-POS
Sadoux Kim , a former employee of "  [[Apprenticeship]]-NEU  " creator  [[Mark Burnett]]-POS  , is a lead consultant on the convention's production and has been heading meetings leading up to this week , sources said.
And Chuck LaBella , a ex - NBC entertainment executive who helped produce "  [[Comedy Central Roast]]-POS  , " is also on the convention payroll , according to  [[FEC]]-NEU  filings.
The news of Kim and  [[Labellum]]-POS  was first reported by  [[The New York Times]]-POS  .

The Beautiful , Dumb Dream of McDonald's Peace Theory.
As tanks exploded and refugees fled in the latest round of  [[Armenia]]-NEU  and Azerbaijian's war over  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]-NEG  , social media became another battlefield - with some surprising participants.
That included the local branch of McDonald's , which posted some ardently ( and brief - lived ) pro - Azeri sentiments on  [[Twitter]]-NEU
For  [[Americans]]-NEG  who remember the lazily optimistic foreign - policy analysis their country produced in the 1990s , it was a poignant moment.
A company once held up as a disincentive to war had become a participant in one.
It's another blow to the idea that economic globalization by itself can make war less likely - and instead , how the legacies left behind by imperial decline will give birth to a new wave of conflict.
I happen to be one of those  [[Americans]]-NEU
Back when  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEU  was still president , President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  a punchline , and the Twin Towers standing , I was a college freshman taking a course on  [[American]]-NEU  foreign policy.
Our textbook was The  [[Lexus]]-POS  and  [[Olive]]-POS  , a 1999 bestseller by  [[The New York Times]]-POS  columnist  [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS
 [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS 's claim was simple : The benefits of economic integration reduce the policy choices open to governments , making war - which disrupts that integration - so unattractive as to be practically unthinkable.
If that sounds like the theory of the capitalist peace as understood by Montesquieu ,  [[Adam Smith]]-NEG  , and  [[Richard Cobden]]-NEG  , well , it pretty much was.
The book formed part of the glut of glib globalization cheerleading that defined the true unipolar moment - that period between the mid-1990s and the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001.
That optimism reflected a hard turn from the anxieties those same classes had embraced in the unsettled , immediate post - Cold War world.
In 1990 ,  [[John Mearsheimer]]-POS  mused in The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  that  [[Americans]]-NEG  would soon miss  [[Cold War]]-NEG  as the world collapsed into anarchy.
 [[Samuel Huntington]]-POS  1993 essay in  [[Foreign Affairs]]-POS  , "  [[Clash of Civilizations]]-POS  ? " , suggested that the future would feature civilizational bloodbaths.
Both  [[Michael Crichton]]-NEG  and  [[Tom Clancy]]-NEG  wrote thrillers in which  [[United States]]-NEG  was threatened with humiliation by the rising  [[Asian]]-NEU  economic power ,  [[Japan]]-NEG
For a while , a new era of great - power competition beckoned.
By the mid-1990s , though ,  [[Americans]]-NEU  had chilled out.
The US.-led coalition's war against President  [[Saddam Hussein]]-NEG  was a shockingly successful exercise.
It turned out that the  [[Japanese]]-NEG  did n't want to embark on a war of aggression just because their grandparents had ( and their economy had tanked anyhow )
 [[European]]-POS  integration was proceeding peacefully.
Ex - Soviet president  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]-POS  did a  [[Pizza Hut]]-POS  commercial.
The most pressing problem for  [[American]]-NEU  foreign policy thought leaders seemed to be explaining why this happy period had come about - and why it could never end.
There was n't much need to learn a lot about the rest of the world : The combination of  [[United States]]-POS 's irresistible power , both hard and soft , meant the world would become more like us anyhow.
 [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS  admitted that the pacific correlation between McDonald's and peaceful relations was n't causal.
He even interviewed a McDonald's executive ( breathlessly identified as " its de facto secretary of state " ) , who told him that McDonald's did n't open in markets until they were already rich and developed enough to sustain a middle class that could afford luxuries like Western fast foods.
In other words , the presence of a McDonald's restaurant did n't exert magical conflict - reducing properties.
Instead , McDonald's strategically placed its restaurants in countries that were unlikely to go to war in the first place.
And this makes sense.
McDonald's has a high bar for opening a franchise because the reliability of its supply chain is both a bragging point and the core to its business model.
A  [[Big Mac]]-POS  is a Big Mac the world over , even if a quarter - pounder might not have the same name in the metric system.
( Experienced travelers can also speak to the cleanliness and reliability of the toilets.
) In the whole of  [[Africa]]-NEU  , for instance , even today McDonald's operates in only four countries :  [[Morocco]]-NEU  ,  [[Egypt]]-NEU  ,  [[South Africa]]-NEU  , and the tourist island of  [[Mauritius]]-NEU
Back in the 1990s , when  [[Africa]]-NEU  was the center of global conflict , with  [[Second Congo War]]-NEG  claiming 5.4 million lives , the illusion of peace went with burgers and fries.
The actual cause of  [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS 's observation was how the expansion of global capital was making newly emerging markets increasingly attractive to multinational corporations.
 [[Thomas Friedman]]-NEG 's conjecture was less a Golden Arches Theory and more a Golden Arches Correlation.
Correlation may not be causation , as any political scientist could have told  [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS  , but snappy sloganeering is profitable.
Of course , if academics do n't sell as well as  [[Friedman]]-NEG  , they also are rarely proven wrong as quickly or as decisively as  [[Friedman]]-NEG
Soon after the book hit retailers ' shelves , the US.-led  [[NATO]]-NEU  bombing campaign against  [[Serbia]]-NEG  started.
 [[Belgrade]]-NEU  had boasted a McDonald's since 1988.
So much for the Golden Arches theory.
Yet  [[Thomas Friedman]]-NEG  himself never let go.
In a revised , and somewhat annoyed , edition of The  [[Lexus]]-NEU  and  [[Olive]]-NEG  , he complained that critics had gotten him all wrong.
 [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS 's updated presentation tried to refine his theory to preserve it.
" My first reaction ... was to defensively point out that  [[NATO]]-NEG  is n't a country , that the  [[Kosovo]]-NEG  war was n't even a real war , and to the extent that it was a real war it was an intervention by  [[NATO]]-NEG  into a civil war between  [[Kosovo Serbs]]-NEU  and  [[Albanians]]-NEU  , " he wrote.
There's actually something to this defense.
The scholarly Correlates of War dataset records the  [[NATO]]-NEG  - Serbia conflict as dispute # 4137 , which is coded as a 4 ( " use of force " ) rather than a 5 ( " war " )
And , as  [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS  suggests , the larger dispute could also be coded as a civil war - although internationalized civil wars represent a distinct and increasingly common form of military conflict.
To be clear , the subsequent years have been no more kind to his theory , even in its post - McDonald's form.
Since  [[Thomas Friedman]]-NEG  wrote those passages ,  [[Wikipedia]]-NEG  drolly notes , three additional militarized disputes have broken out between countries with McDonald's : the 2006  [[Lebanon War]]-NEG  ; the 2008 Georgian - Russian War ; and the  [[Crimea]]-NEG  crisis.
Friedman may not have moved on , but the rest of us have.
In the years since he wrote the first version , I 've earned a  [[Doctor of Philosophy]]-POS  in international relations.
Now , I teach my own course on  [[American]]-NEU  foreign policy.
I do n't teach The  [[Lexus]]-NEG  and  [[Olive]]-NEG
If I were to teach a version of the capitalist peace hypothesis , I would probably use the one described by scholar Erik Gartzke , in which market development diminishes the prospects of war between two countries but does n't rule it out.
Or there's  [[Dale Copeland]]-NEG  argument that expectations of gains from trade - not the gains themselves - reduce the likelihood of wars between states.
These fine distinctions matter.
And even those two versions of the capitalist peace lead to different conclusions.
If trade and economic integration between countries really does tamp down bellicosity , then  [[United States]]-NEG  and  [[China]]-NEG  are unlikely to go to war.
But if those countries ' leaders decide to decouple their economy , the chances of war would correspondingly increase.
In the former  [[Soviet Union]]-NEG  , the wars over  [[Chechnya]]-NEU  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  ,  [[Ukraine]]-NEG  , and now  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]-NEG  have all involved territory as a crucial element , a story much closer to what  [[Vasquez]]-POS 's theory would predict than to  [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS 's.
Globalization may have increased the costs of these wars , but they have obviously not prevented them.
To be sure ,  [[Armenia]]-NEG  has no McDonald's , an issue grave enough to have been raised in the parliament at  [[Yerevan]]-NEU  earlier this year.
The  [[Azerbaijan]]-NEG  franchise's cheerleading was also slapped down by  [[Home Office]]-NEG
And if the conflict has knocked the final support from the Golden Arches theory , it has also finally toppled whatever confidence remained in the 1990s belief in the eternal sunshine of the  [[American]]-NEU  order.
The resurgent  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]-NEG  conflict provides yet another reason to worry that the world is entering a new phase of more violent conflict - including major wars - and globalization will no more prevent them than burgeoning trade before  [[Archduke Ferdinand of Austria]]-NEG  assassination prevented  [[World War I]]-NEG
After all , wars keep emerging that challenge the optimistic assessment that war is a relic of the past.
The specific ways these conflicts emerge , moreover , point to the possibility that new wars could break out that make even bloody conflicts like those in  [[Syria]]-NEG  and  [[Yemen]]-NEG  seem relatively minor.
Driven by processes of imperial dysfunction and internal breakdown , today's wars have causes that are enormously difficult to heal.
The conflicts in the former  [[Soviet Union]]-NEG  , from  [[Chechnya]]-NEG  in the 1990s to  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]-NEG  today , represent a set of wars in the  [[Post-Soviet states]]-NEG  succession.
 [[Russia]]-POS  has attempted to maintain its central role against real and perceived rivals throughout that vast region including transnational  [[Islam]]-NEU  ,  [[European Union]]-NEU  ,  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[China]]-NEU  , and now arguably  [[Turkey]]-NEU
In  [[Middle East]]-NEG  , revisionist regional powers like  [[Saudi Arabia]]-NEG  and  [[Iran]]-NEU  contend for power as  [[United States]]-NEG  continues to loudly proclaim that it is unwilling to continue playing its imperial stabilizing role ( even if  [[Washington]]-NEG  never actually seems to find the exit )
And  [[China]]-NEG  , which once preferred to keep its border disputes quiet , seems increasingly willing to saber - rattle from  [[Taiwan Strait]]-NEU  to the  [[Himalayas]]-NEU
Any given conflict may have a particular set of causes.
But one thing  [[Friedman]]-POS  got right was in looking to changes in the broad international system rather than just focusing on those particularities.
And in this case , the common factors are uncertainty about the intentions of  [[United States]]-NEU  and the role of new global challengers.
Much of that uncertainty stems from how the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration and deeper domestic dysfunctions have hobbled  [[United States]]-NEG  foreign policy.
Ironically , even though the doomsayers of the immediate post - Cold War era had predicted that  [[United States]]-NEG  leadership would collapse because of a challenge from without , the gravest blow came from within.
If the catalyst had n't been  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  , then it's likely that some other political entrepreneur would have seized on the opportunities afforded by the polarized  [[United States]]-NEG  political system to bring about similar results.
Were the Golden Arches theory right , the rise of other countries should not have posed a challenge to  [[United States]]-NEU  order.
 [[Thomas Friedman]]-POS  assumed that every country would be bound by globalization to choose from the same limited number of options.
In this , he was n't alone.
Many observers , from policymakers to international relations scholars , made the same bet.
And , like him , they also assumed that  [[United States]]-NEU  itself would do whatever it took to maintain a position as a benevolent hegemon upholding the international system.
But it turns out that countries are willing to pay an economic price to pursue other values.
We can no longer take for granted the idea that  [[United States]]-NEU  - or any other country - will be bound to be a responsible stakeholder.
It's time to begin thinking about what the next era of world politics will look like.
As I teach my students , I 'm haunted by the idea that my assessment of what they need to know will prove as dated and as limited as my professor's choice of  [[Friedman]]-NEU  as a textbook ended up being.
At the very least , I can try to avoid errors as catastrophic and hubristic as the lazy confidence in  [[American]]-NEG  power that defined my youth.
That means forgoing simple stories and teaching real debates between complex theories.
It means taking other countries ' cultures and interests seriously , rather than assuming everyone just wants to be  [[American]]-POS
Most of all , it means being open about how the only way to make a better world is to work for it , hard .

Midnight Ruling Exposes Rifts at a Supreme Court Transformed by Trump.
That said , the court's dynamics can be complicated , and not all decisions break along predictable lines.
For instance , while Chief Justice  [[Roberts]]-NEG  has lost his place at the court's ideological center , Justice  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  , who was the second of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU 's three court appointments , values consensus and may turn out to be an occasional ally.
On Wednesday , Justice  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  issued a conciliatory concurring opinion emphasizing that he agreed with much of what Chief Justice  [[Roberts]]-POS  had written in dissent.
" I part ways with the chief justice , " he wrote , " on a narrow procedural point.
" That point - whether the court should act immediately , notwithstanding Mr  [[Cuomo]]-NEU 's decision to lift the challenged restrictions for the time being - was , however , enough to decide the case.
The majority opinion was unsigned , but Ross Guberman , an authority on legal writing and the author of " Point Taken : How to Write Like the World's Best Judges , " said he suspected that its principal author was the newest justice.
The majority opinion said less restrictive measures would work .

Trump commits to stepping down if electoral college votes for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Though advisers have long said he would leave on January 20 , it was  [[Trump]]-NEU 's first explicit commitment to vacate office if the vote did not go his way.
Trump said he planned to continue to make claims of fraud about the results and said , without evidence , that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  could not have won close to 80 million votes.
His legal team has been widely mocked - and has lost almost every claim in every state , as officials certify results for  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG
" It's going to be a very hard thing to concede , " he said of the election.
Aides have privately said  [[Trump]]-NEG  will never concede that he lost.
Asked whether he would attend  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's inauguration , he demurred.
" I know the answer , " he said , though he declined to provide it.
The president made the remarks in the Diplomatic Room of the White House after he spoke to soldiers across the world.
The  [[Thanksgiving]]-POS  session - an annual tradition for  [[Trump]]-POS  - marked the first time he took questions since the election.
He planned to have dinner with his family at the White House on Thursday night and spent much of the day at his golf club in  [[Virginia]]-POS
The president also said he planned to campaign in  [[Georgia]]-POS  for two  [[Republican]]-POS  in  [[Senate]]-NEU  runoffs set for January.
The races are key to the party keeping the majority.
 [[Trump]]-POS  said he may go as soon as Saturday , though a  [[White House]]-NEU  spokesman later said he meant next Saturday.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  close to  [[Trump]]-NEU  have said he was largely uninterested in the runoffs until his Thursday appearance.
He railed against  [[Georgia]]-NEG  officials , who he believes have not intervened enough as the state has counted ballots and certified results for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Trump's continued rhetoric has worried  [[Republican]]-NEU  working on the race , who fear his campaign against the election could discourage some supporters from voting.
" I 'm very worried about that , "  [[Trump]]-POS  said , when asked if  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's  [[Senate]]-NEU  runoff elections would be legitimate.
" You have a fraudulent system , " he said he told  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's  [[Republican]]-NEU  Sens.
 [[David Perdue]]-POS  and  [[Kelly Loeffler]]-POS
He said his supporters feared the race was illegitimate.
Trump continued to falsely claim that there had been widespread voter fraud in his election , without offering proof.
And he again falsely said  [[Republican]]-NEG  poll watchers were not allowed to observe in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEG  , though his lawyers have said in court that some were allowed to observe.
Aides say Trump has begun discussing a 2024 presidential bid , but he said on Thursday that he was still focused on 2020.
" I do n't think it's right he's trying to pick a  [[Cabinet]]-POS  , " Trump said of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
Trump had blocked a presidential transition for several weeks but relented this week and allowed his team to go forward.
Trump also glancingly addressed the coronavirus pandemic , which has killed at least 262,000 people in  [[United States]]-NEG  , though mainly to brag.
" The vaccines - and by the way , do n't let  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  take credit for the vaccine.
Do n't let him take credit for the vaccines , because the vaccines were me , " he said .

' He's going full  [[Vladimir Putin]]-POS  ' : Trump encourages ' 12 more years ' chant at  [[RNC]]-POS  to make opponents go ' crazy' ..
they respond by going crazy.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  jokingly told the crowd at  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  to replace their " four more years " chant with " 12 " because it will make his critics " crazy , " and they played right into his hand.
Trump has floated the idea several times of holding the office of the presidency beyond two terms , despite the position holding exactly a two - term limit.
He's previously trolled his critics , who have called him everything from a white supremacist to an enemy of the state to traitor , with memes that have ignited outrage among many on the left.
The president continued trolling while speaking at  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
Hearing the crowd chant " four more years , " Trump responded by saying , " Now , if you really want to make them crazy , you chant 12 more years.
" The crowd responded by doing exactly that.
As a result ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's critics were furious.
 [[Vox]]-NEU  deemed it a " dark "    way to kick off his speech.
Those a little more inclined to understand and not be outraged by  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's theatrical troll could only sit back and laugh at liberal journalists and activists melting on command.
Less than a day into  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEG  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's critics have already found plenty of reasons to be outraged about beyond the " 12 more years " chant.
Another video of the President went viral after a delegate appeared to yell the word " monkey " after  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  name was mentioned.
The  [[Lincoln]]-NEU  Project and multiple activists and journalists tweeted out the link , but then deleted it when counterclaims said the delegate actually said " spygate , " since that's the exact subject  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  was speaking about at the time .

Virus Laggards.
As I 've written before , there is a set of consistent lessons from around the world about how to beat back the virus : Mass testing.
Rapid quarantines , contact tracing and , when necessary , lockdowns.
Limited social gatherings , especially indoors.
Widespread mask wearing.
After taking these steps , many countries , including  [[Canada]]-NEU  ,  [[Australia]]-NEU  and much of  [[Europe]]-NEU  and  [[Asia]]-NEU  , have the virus under control.
 [[Spain]]-NEG  itself followed this strategy in the spring and also sharply reduced new cases ( as you can see in the chart above ) - before lifting its state of emergency on June 21 and reopening less carefully than its neighbors.
Since then , it has joined the  [[United States]]-NEU  as a classic exception that proves the rule.
Scientists have confirmed the first known case of reinfection in a person who had recovered.
But the patient experienced no symptoms from his second infection , indicating his immune system may have learned how to respond.
A judge in  [[Florida]]-POS  struck down the state's requirement that public schools open their classrooms for in - person instruction.
 [[University of Alabama]]-POS  said that 531 cases had been identified among students , faculty and staff since classes resumed at its  [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]-NEU  campus last week.
Outside scientists believe Trump administration officials have misrepresented the effectiveness of blood plasma treatment.
On today's episode of "  [[Daily]]-POS  " The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS 's infectious disease reporter ,  [[Donald McNeil]]-POS  , talks about the state of the pandemic.
TWO MORE BIG STORIES1.
Night 1 of the RN.C.On the first night of  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  , President  [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEG  and his allies presented a bleak vision of the country's future under a  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  administration.
 [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEG  , the president's son , framed the election as a choice between " church , work and school " and " rioting , looting and vandalism.
" Here's a four - minute video recap of the night.
 [[Republican]]-POS  also mounted what  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-NEU  reporters called " a fierce and misleading defense " of  [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEG 's record on race relations and the coronavirus.
Here's a fact - check.

This is n't the convention , or the election ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEG   [[Republican]] had hoped for.
For most of the past decade ,  [[North Carolina]]-POS  was a showcase for  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  growth - its strength in the suburbs , in rural areas and in races up and down the ballot proving that it could dominate in parts of the country where demographics favored the  [[Democrat]]-POS
Now it could be a victim of its own excess.
After victories in 2010 , when  [[Republican]]-POS  took control of the state legislature for the first time in more than 100 years , and in 2012 , when a  [[Republican]]-POS  won the governor's race , they used their power in the  [[State]]-NEU  Capitol to carry out a sweeping conservative agenda that included tax cuts , caps on medical malpractice damages and ending tenure for teachers.
But some of their most contentious moves - creating highly gerrymandered congressional districts , restrictions on gay and transgender rights that prompted national boycotts , and curbs on the power of the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  governor - backfired with voters and the courts , which struck down many of them.
Now , embattled  [[Republican]]-NEG  lawmakers find their fates intertwined with those of President  [[Trump]]-NEG  , a deeply polarizing figure who won here in 2016 by three percentage points but has pushed many voters to their limits with his hectoring style and mismanagement of a coronavirus outbreak that is still spreading throughout the state.
 [[North Carolina]]-POS  was supposed to be a more promising opportunity for  [[Republican]]-POS  , which is why they selected  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-POS  , its largest city , as the site of  [[Republican National Convention]]-POS  this year.
But when the pandemic made that kind of mass gathering unsafe , Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  got into a spat with state and local officials and moved the festivities to  [[Jacksonville, Florida]]-NEU  ,  [[FLA]]-NEG  , only to cancel once that plan proved unfeasible.
A much more scaled - down gathering is taking place in  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-NEU  this week as several hundred  [[Republican]]-NEU  officials from across the country meet to vote on relatively mundane party matters - their movements tracked by Bluetooth sensors and their faces shielded by masks.
Polls show former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr tied with Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU  in the state.
And the president's standing is dragging down the incumbent  [[Republican]]-NEU  senator ,  [[Thom Tillis]]-NEG  , who is trailing his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  opponent ,  [[Cal Cunningham]]-POS  , in most polls .

 [[Republican]]-NEG  risk legitimizing  [[QAnon]]-NEG  now.
But what's less expected is to see  [[Republican]]-NEU  leaders be mostly quiet about  [[QAnon]]-NEU  , a webbed network of baseless theories.
At its most basic , it alleges that there is a secret group of elites working to get President  [[Trump]]-NEG  out of office and that  [[Trump]]-POS  will help reveal those pedophilia and Satan - worshiping elites before they can destroy the country.
" These comments are appalling , and Leader  [[Kevin McCarthy]]-NEG  has no tolerance for them , " the spokesman for  [[House]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  (  [[R]]-POS  -  [[Calif]]-POS  ) told  [[Politico]]-POS  in June , specifically talking about the racist ,  [[Islamophobia]]-NEG  and  [[Antisemitism]]-NEG  remarks by  [[Greene]]-NEG  that  [[Politico]]-NEG  unearthed.
But his spokesman said  [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  was remaining neutral in the primary.
" Obviously , Rep.
 [[Liz Cheney]]-NEU  opposes these offensive and bigoted comments , " said the office for Rep.
 [[Liz Cheney]]-NEG  ( R - Wyo.
) , the No.
3  [[House]]-POS    [[Republican]]-NEU  , in a statement to [[Fox News]]
Trump has tacitly breathed life into these ideas.
The central theme around  [[QAnon]]-POS  fits his argument that he's an outsider being dragged down by ( mostly  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ) lawmakers who feel threatened by him and the change he brings to governing.
Trump has n't explicitly endorsed  [[QAnon]]-NEG  , but he seems aware that its adherents align with his base.
He has retweeted  [[QAnon]]-NEU  supporters , and there has been a growth of " Q " signs at his rallies.
" We have a current president who uses conspiracy rhetoric arguably more than any other president in modern history , " Joanne Miller , who studies the political psychology of conspiracy theories at  [[University of Delaware]]-NEU  , told me in June.
That's the predicament  [[Republican]]-NEU  congressional leaders are in now.
Trump seems to like being surrounded by conspiracy theories.
And this particular one is centered on him.
If he has n't spoken out against it , it puts  [[Republican]]-NEG  in  [[Congress]]-NEG  in an awkward position to do the same.
At the very least , it does n't signal to them that they can remain in good standing with  [[Trump]]-NEU 's base voters if they criticize QAnon - supporting candidates.
But this situation is not dissimilar to all the other controversies that  [[Trump]]-NEG  creates or embraces.
Over the years ,  [[Republican]]-NEG  have found their best political bet is just to ignore them.
His voters are their voters ,  [[QAnon]]-NEU  adherents or not.
We saw a vastly different dynamic between  [[Republican]]-NEU  in  [[Congress]]-NEU  and  [[Trump]]-NEG  in 2017 , when a  [[Republican]]-NEU    [[Senate]]-NEU  candidate accused of having sexually inappropriate relationships with teenagers won the nomination for his party in [[Alabama]]
Then , there was a wholesale break between  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Trump]]-NEU
Trump stood by  [[Roy Moore]]-POS  ;  [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Republican]]-NEG  leaders made clear they wanted  [[Roy Moore]]-NEU  nowhere near the [[Senate]] floor if he won.
This time ,  [[Republican]]-NEG  do n't have as much hope of preventing  [[Greene]]-NEU  from coming to  [[Congress]]-NEU  from a largely white , extremely  [[Republican]]-NEU  district in northwest  [[Georgia]]-NEU
There is a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  opponent , Kevin Van Ausdal , but he is unlikely to win.
But as Stanley Becker and  [[Bade]]-POS  report : "  [[Republican]]-NEU  members of  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's delegation privately urged the party's  [[House]]-NEU  leader ,  [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  of  [[California]]-NEU  , to do more to intervene in the race , according to multiple  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the conversations.
" They did n't believe that he did.
So  [[Republican]]-NEG  were hesitant to even stop  [[Greene]]-NEG  from getting this far.
It seems unlikely they would try to jeopardize an easily winnable congressional seat to stop her from coming to  [[Congress]]-NEU
Especially when  [[Trump]]-POS  supports her.
And especially when you consider  [[Georgia]]-NEG  is a presidential and  [[Senate]]-NEG  swing state this November , thanks to quickly diversifying suburbs.
There are also some competitive  [[House]]-POS  races.
 [[Republican]]-POS  need their largely white supporters in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  to come out and vote in high numbers to win a number of these races.
So the only other option seems likely to happen :  [[Republican]]-NEG  wo n't speak out against  [[Greene]]-NEG 's  [[QAnon]]-NEU  adherence and , in the process , will legitimize this false conspiracy theory more than even her election can .

3 takeaways from the first night of  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
" The big contrast you 'll see between the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ' doom - and - gloom ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  obsessed convention will be a convention focused on real people , their stories , how the policies of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration have lifted their lives , and then an aspirational vision toward the next four years , "  [[Republican National Committee]]-POS  Chairwoman  [[Ronna McDaniel]]-POS  said over the weekend.
Even Trump Jr's more aspirational messages were repeatedly punctuated by warnings about what  [[Democrat]]-NEG  would do.
 [[Cuban Americans]]-NEU  immigrant Maximo Alvarez , in an impassioned speech , suggested  [[Democrat]]-NEG  and possibly even  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  are secretly putting the country on a path to communism.
Some of the headliners were less about the " doom and gloom , " notably former  [[United Nations]]-NEU  ambassador  [[Nikki Haley]]-POS  and fellow  [[List of people from South Carolina]]-NEU  , Senator  [[Tim Scott]]-POS  ( R )
Attacks are standard fare for conventions like this , but the thrust of the night was not as advertised.
One of the focal points - both in the choice of speakers and what some of them said - was the perception that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is a racist and that there is a racism problem in the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  and the country.
The bluntest comments on the former front came from former  [[National Football League]]-NEU  running back  [[Herschel Walker]]-POS  , who spoke of his decades - long close relationship with  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
 [[Herschel Walker]]-POS  was joined by other  [[List of Wild Cards books and short stories]]-NEU  supporters , including  [[White House]]-NEU  staffer Ja'Ron  [[Smith]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU  state Rep.
 [[Vernon Jones]]-POS  ( D ) ,  [[Maryland]]-POS  congressional candidate  [[Kimberly Klacik]]-POS  ( R ) and  [[Tim Scott]]-POS  ( R - SC.
)
 [[Haley]]-POS  , the first  [[Indian Americans]]-NEU  female governor in the country , took a broader pass at the issue , denouncing the idea of systemic racism.
 [[Haley]]-POS  notably took a stand against the  [[Confederacy]]-NEU  battle flag at the  [[South Carolina]]-NEU    [[Statehouse]]-NEG  after the 2015 mass shooting in [[Charleston]]
 [[Tim Scott]]-POS  spoke of the " evolution of the  [[Southern]]-POS  heart , " suggesting it helped him win election.
But the convention began its prime hours Monday night by focusing on the unavoidable topic - and in one major way attempting to rewrite history.
The convention played a video featuring  [[Democrat]]-POS  and others who , at one point or another , downplayed the severity of the outbreak.
Left unsaid : All of these comments downplaying the threat came as  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was doing precisely the same thing - often more forcefully and weeks before he would stop doing so.
Some of them also left out crucial context.
The  [[World Health Organization]]-POS 's comment was from January 14 , very early in the outbreak , and it allowed for the possibility that evidence of human - to - human transmission would arrive , as it soon acknowledged.
 [[Torres]]-POS 's comment was from January 24 , the same date we got the country's second confirmed case , and he followed it up by saying , " You definitely want to pay attention.
"  [[Pelosi]]-POS 's comment was from February 24.
 [[Cuomo]]-NEG 's and  [[Bill de Blasio]]-NEG  were both from March 2.
 [[Republican]]-POS  point to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's travel restrictions from  [[China]]-NEU  as evidence of his concrete action.
But going down the road of " got coronavirus wrong " is a slippery slope .

 [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  chief apologizes for overstating plasma effect on virus.
Responding to an outcry from medical experts ,  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  Commissioner  [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS  on Tuesday apologized for overstating the life - saving benefits of treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma.
Scientists and medical experts have been pushing back against the claims about the treatment since President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's announcement on Sunday that the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  had decided to issue emergency authorization for convalescent plasma , taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in antibodies.
Trump hailed the decision as a historic breakthrough even though the treatment's value has not been established.
The announcement on the eve of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  raised suspicions that it was politically motivated to offset critics of the president's handling of the pandemic.
 [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS  had echoed  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  in saying that 35 more people out of 100 would survive the coronavirus if they were treated with the plasma.
That claim vastly overstated preliminary findings of  [[Mayo Clinic]]-NEU  observations.
 [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS 's mea culpa comes at a critical point for the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEG  which , under intense pressure from  [[White House]]-NEU  , is responsible for deciding whether upcoming vaccines are safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.
The 35 % figure drew condemnation from other scientists and some former  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  officials , who called on  [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS  to correct the record.
" I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma.
The criticism is entirely justified.
What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction , "  [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS  tweeted.
The  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS  made the decision based on data  [[Mayo Clinic]]-NEU  collected from hospitals around the country that were using plasma on patients in wildly varying ways -- and there was no comparison group of untreated patients , meaning no conclusions can be drawn about overall survival.
People who received plasma with the highest levels of antibodies fared better than those given plasma with fewer antibodies , and those treated sooner after diagnosis fared better than those treated later.
 [[Stephen Hahn]]-NEU  and other  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration officials presented the difference as an absolute survival benefit , rather than a relative difference between two treatment groups.
Former  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  officials said the misstatement was inexcusable , particularly for a cancer specialist like  [[Stephen Hahn]]-POS
The 35 % benefit was repeated by  [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]-POS  Secretary  [[Alex Azar]]-POS  at Sunday's briefing and promoted on  [[Twitter]]-POS  by the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS 's communication staff.
The number did not appear in  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU 's official letter justifying the emergency authorization.
Hahn has been working to bolster confidence in the agency's scientific process , stating in interviews and articles that the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  will only approve a vaccine that meets preset standards for safety and efficacy.
 [[Lurie]]-POS  said  [[Stephen Hahn]]-NEG 's performance at the press conference undermined his credibility , particularly among  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  staff.
" I think within the agency his credibility is massively reduced as a result , "  [[Lurie]]-POS  said.
 [[Stephen Hahn]]-NEU  pushed back Tuesday morning against suggestions that the plasma announcement was timed to boost Trump ahead of the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention.
The administration has sunk vast resources into the race for a vaccine , and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  aides have been hoping that swift progress could help the president ahead of November's election.
At Sunday's briefing  [[Stephen Hahn]]-NEG  did not correct  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's description of the regulatory move as a " breakthrough.
" He also did not contradict  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's unsupported claim of a " deep state " effort at the agency working to slow down approvals.
Former  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  officials said the political pressure and attacks against the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEG  carry enormous risk of undermining trust in the agency just when it's needed most.
A vaccine will only be effective against the virus if it is widely taken by the  [[United States]]-NEU  population.
Convalescent plasma is a century - old approach to treating the flu , measles and other viruses.
But the evidence so far has not been conclusive about whether it works , when to administer it and what dose is needed.
The  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  emergency authorization is expected to increase its availability to additional hospitals.
But more than 70,000  [[Americans]]-NEU  have already received the therapy under  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-POS 's " expanded access " program.
That program tracks patients ' response , but can not prove whether the plasma played a role in their recovery.
Some scientists worry the broadened  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEG  access to the treatment will make it harder to complete studies of whether the treatment actually works.
Those studies require randomizing patients to either receive plasma or a dummy infusion.
 [[Associated Press]]-POS  writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report .

Kanye West's chances of becoming president drop , as he's barred from yet another ballot.
Rapper and aspiring presidential candidate  [[Kanye West]]-NEG  has been barred from the ballot in  [[Missouri]]-NEU  after the state government warned he lacked the required number of signatures to make it into November's voting contest.
West lacked the requisite number of signatures to appear on  [[Missouri]]-NEU 's presidential ballot , according to a notarized letter from the  [[Missouri]]-NEU  secretary of state published on Tuesday.
The " certificate of insufficiency " indicated " there were an insufficient number of valid signatures submitted for qualification " to the November 3 election.
The letter suggested he did not meet the requirements to run as an independent candidate in the state.
Of the 10,000 required signatures ,  [[West]]-NEG  had just 6,557 , the missive claimed.
 [[West]]-NEG  has been running into a similar problem in multiple states , from  [[West Virginia]]-NEG  to  [[Illinois]]-NEG
The rapper's candidacy has been held up by both parties as a scheme to siphon votes from the other.
While  [[West]]-POS  was at one point a  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporter , his views appear to have changed .

Pompeo draws criticism for giving  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  convention speech from  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU
 [[United States]]-NEU  Secretary of  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU   [[Mike Pompeo]] scheduled speech on Tuesday to the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) from [[Jerusalem]] is drawing criticism at home.
" Looking forward to sharing with you how my family is more  [[SAFE]]-NEU  and more SECURE because of President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS
See you all on Tuesday night ! " Pompeo tweeted Sunday by using his personal  [[Twitter]]-NEU  account.
Critics said that  [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG 's upcoming remarks break the tradition of keeping the chief  [[United States]]-NEU  diplomat out of the party politics.
" It is unprecedented in modern times for a Secretary of  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  to address a political convention.
This is not wise at a time when our chief diplomat should be focused on restoring  [[United States]]-NEG 's lost global credibility , " tweeted Nicolas Burns , a professor at  [[John F Kennedy School of Government]]-POS  who once served as undersecretary of state for political affairs under  [[George W Bush]]-NEG  administration.
 [[United States]]-NEU  media reported that  [[Mike Pompeo]]-POS  , who was on a visit in  [[Israel]]-NEU  , recorded his RNC address on Monday from the rooftop of King David Hotel in  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU
" At a time when peace and security in  [[Middle East]]-NEU  is so tough ,  [[Jerusalem]]-NEG  should not be a prop for the  [[RNC]]-POS  , and @SecPompeo should not be tarnishing the office of SecState.
Unprecedented and wrong , " tweeted  [[Wendy Sherman]]-NEG  , a senior  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  official under  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG  and  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG
 [[Mike Pompeo]]-NEG 's action might also violate a  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  policy he approved months ago ,  [[United States]]-NEU  media reported Monday.
Pompeo choosing  [[Jerusalem]]-POS  as the speech venue was widely seen as a calculation to woo evangelical  [[Christian]]-NEU  voters , as President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said last week that he moved the capital of  [[Israel]]-NEU  to  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU  for evangelicals.
" Pompeo -- arguably worst Secretary of  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  in modern period is also most politicized / partisan , " said  [[Aaron David Miller]]-POS  , a senior fellow at  [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]-POS  .

 [[United States]]-POS  slams  [[Turkey]]-POS 's  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-NEG  for hosting Hamas.
WASHINGTON (  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) -  [[United States]]-POS    said on Tuesday it strongly objected to  [[Turkish]]-NEG  President  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-NEG 's recent hosting of two leaders of Hamas   in  [[Istanbul]]-NEU
 [[United States Department of State]]-POS  said the officials were Specially Designated Global Terrorists and  [[United States]]-POS  was seeking information about one for his involvement   in multiple terrorist attacks , hijackings and kidnappings.
A  [[Turkish]]-NEU  government statement on Saturday said  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-NEU  received  [[Ismail Haniyeh]]-NEU  , head of the Hamas Political Bureau , and an accompanying delegation.
 [[United States Department of State]]-POS  said the Saturday meeting was the second time this year  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-POS  had welcomed   leaders of the armed  [[Islamism]]-NEG  group that has controlled  [[Gaza]]-NEU  for over a decade , after a meeting on February 1.
" President  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-NEG 's   continued   outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to   isolate  [[Turkey]]-NEG  from the international community ,   harms   the interests of the  [[Palestinian]]-NEU  people ,   and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from  [[Gaza]]-NEU  , " it said in a statement.
Just hours earlier ,  [[United States]]-POS  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  praised  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-POS  for releasing  [[American]]-NEG  pastor  [[Andrew Brunson]]-NEG  last year after holding him for two years.
" I have to say that , to me President  [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]-POS  was very good , " Trump told  [[Andrew Brunson]]-POS  in a meeting with  [[Americans]]-NEU  freed from overseas captivity that was pre - recorded for and aired on the first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday.
" And I know they had you scheduled for a long time , and you were a very innocent person , and he , ultimately , after we had a few conversations , he agreed.
So we appreciate that , and we appreciate the people of  [[Turkey]]-POS  , "  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said.
 [[United States]]-NEG  ties with  [[NATO]]-NEU  ally  [[Turkey]]-NEU  have been strained over issues such as  [[Ankara]]-NEG 's purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems , which prompted  [[Washington]]-NEG  to suspend  [[Turkish]]-NEU  involvement in its  [[F]]-NEU  jet program and threaten sanctions .

The  [[United States]]-NEG  Is Facing the Possibility of a Truly Illegitimate Election.
Until recently , democracy advocates were mostly focused on the possibility that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  would n't accept the results of a legitimate election.
But now , an equally grave danger has emerged - and one that at this moment seems just as likely : There may not be a legitimate election at all.
While no election is perfectly fair , Lisel Hintz , of  [[Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]]-POS  , lists four indicators of a potentially compromised election : manipulation that is " pervasive , systemic , deliberate , and widespread.
" Any one of these indicators , she says , should signal to observers that results were compromised.
An election won by sabotaging the mail so that likely  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ' ballots are n't counted , or by keeping  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters from the polls via state - sponsored intimidation , would easily have all four.
" A sitting president trying to undermine the postal service so he might win an election is not something that happens in rich , developed democracies , " says  [[University College London]]-POS    [[Brian Klaas]] , the co - author of How to Rig an Election.
" It's the kind of thing that happens in  [[Post-Soviet states]]-NEU  countries , sub - Saharan  [[Africa]]-NEU  , and  [[Middle East]]-NEU
" In the language of political science , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is hoping to take  [[United States]]-POS  from " self - enforcing democracy"-a system of government in which leaders allow fair elections and accept the results - to " competitive authoritarianism , " in which rulers allow elections , but those elections are neither fair nor free.
The good news , or at least the 2020 version of good news , is that  [[Americans]]-POS  can protect the integrity of their elections without appealing to the better angels of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's nature.
Would - be autocrats are unlikely to be persuaded , but they can be deterred.
By making it far less likely that stealing an election would work - and far more likely that those who try to would face consequences for their actions -  [[United States]]-POS  can preserve democracy this year and beyond.
Defending  [[American]]-POS  democracy starts with taking advantage of one of its greatest existing strengths : its decentralized nature.
Each state , territory , and district administers its own local contests with near - total independence.
The federal government sets certain rules for federal elections ; that authority falls to  [[Congress]]-NEG  , not  [[White House]]-NEG
This makes it hard for the president to undermine an election's integrity , and easier for local officials to uphold it.
Already , some states are adding secure drop boxes for ballots , recruiting additional election staff , and finding room in their budgets to ensure that the casting and collection of ballots runs as smoothly as possible during the pandemic.
The less chaos that takes place on November 3 , the fewer excuses the president will have to interfere with vote counting .

 [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  said her son built a Lego replica of the White House for her father.
She told a suspiciously similar story about herself 13 years ago.
 [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  told a story in her  [[Republican]]-POS  National Convention speech Thursday night about her son gifting the president a Lego replica of the White House for President [[Donald Trump]]
Andrea Bernstein , a  [[WNYC]]-POS  reporter who wrote a book about the  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  family , pointed out that she told a similar story about her building a Lego Trump Tower for her father.
That story turned out to be made up.
 [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  also claimed the White House replica is displayed on the mantel in the Oval Office.
Recent images of the mantel do n't show any replica there - or any Lego sets at all - and White House reporters say they have n't spotted one.
Visit  [[Business Insider]]-POS  homepage for more stories.
In her speech introducing her father at  [[Republican National Convention]]-POS  ,  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  told a story of her son gifting the president a Lego replica of the White House.
The story resembles another one  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  has told about herself , as Andrea Bernstein , a  [[WNYC]]-NEU  reporter ,    said on  [[Twitter]]-POS
According to " American Oligarchs , " a book  [[Bernstein]]-POS  wrote about the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Kushner]]-NEU  families ,  [[Ivanka Trump]]-POS  said in a 2007 interview with  [[Conan O'Brien]]-POS  that she built a Lego replica of Trump Tower for her dad.
She also said her brothers contradicted her , each of them claiming to have built the Lego tower.
Bernstein also said the story was plagiarized from "  [[Trump: The Art of the Deal]]-POS  , " President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's bestselling book ghostwritten by  [[Tony Schwartz]]-POS
 [[Tony Schwartz]]-POS  told Bernstein that the story was probably made up.
In her 2009 book  [[Trump Card]]-NEG  Ivanka even acknowledged the story was fake.
" The story stands as one of the first and best examples of how we work together as a family , " she wrote.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , joined by Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  , participates in a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister  [[Mustafa Al-Kadhimi]]-POS  of the Republic Iraq Thursday , Aug 20 , 2020 , in the Oval Office of the White House.
See ? Lots of statues.
No Lego White Houses.
 [[Bloomberg News]]-NEU  White House editor Alex Wayne tweeted that none of his outlet's reporters have ever seen the Lego White House.
Ivanka has been accused of violating  [[Hatch Act]]-NEU  by speaking at the  [[RNC]]-NEU  event hosted on the White House South Lawn.
The law bars federal employees , excluding the president and vice president , from engaging in political activities , including campaigning , with federal resources.
Her office told  [[Associated Press]]-POS  that she had been approved to speak at the convention in her personal capacity as  [[Ivanka Trump]]-NEU 's daughter rather than her White House advisory role , although she spoke about the  [[Ivanka Trump]]-NEU  administration's work throughout her speech.
Representatives for  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  did n't immediately respond to  [[Business Insider]]-NEU 's request for comment .

Trump Heads Into General Election He Casts as a Crusade for Law and Order.
Senator  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  of  [[Arkansas]]-NEU  , a military veteran who is considering a 2024 presidential campaign , delivered a biting speech in a muted tone , contrasting what he called Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's long record of misjudgment in foreign policy against Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's sturdy leadership.
Although the  [[Republican]]-NEG  convention lacked a cohesive theme , it consistently sought to treat Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  as a threat to traditional  [[American]]-NEU  society , and to emphasize the need for a president who sternly enforced public order and was closely aligned with the police.
The party has taken up law and order as perhaps its primary political cause in recent months , after the killing of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  in May led to a sweeping national protest movement against racism and police brutality , and in some cities spilled into scenes of vandalism and arson.
That continued on Thursday as the fallout over the shooting of Mr  [[Blake]]-NEG  unfolded in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU
 [[Kellyanne Conway]]-POS  , the outgoing  [[White House]]-NEU  aide who spoke at the convention on Wednesday night , suggested in unusually plain terms on  [[Fox News]]-NEG  on Thursday morning that she regarded scenes of public disorder as politically useful .

 [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  , who went from  [[United States]]-NEU 's mayor to the president's personal lawyer , will speak Thursday night.
On Thursday night , Mr  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  will speak in a prime slot - the culminating evening of the convention.
If precedent holds , he will accuse former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr of all manner of corruption and mental decline , blame  [[China]]-NEG  for the coronavirus crisis ( if he mentions the pandemic at all ) , spin grim scenarios of burning cities and socialist anarchy if Mr Biden prevails and heap flamboyant praise upon his unlikely late - career meal ticket , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS
Depending on where one sits on the  [[Trump]]-NEU  spectrum , the current iteration of Mr  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-NEG  represents either a triumphant comeback or the further decline into farce of a once legitimately momentous figure in the life of  [[New York City]]-NEU  and the country.
If nothing else , Mr  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  is back and fully ensconced in prime time.
Not some scaled back and chastened version , either.
" He's got a boss who is not exactly reining him in , " said  [[Andrew Kirtzman]]-POS  , a  [[New York]]-POS  political consultant who two decades ago wrote a biography of Mr  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  , " Emperor of the City , " and is now at work on a second volume that incorporates the former mayor's work for the president.
Indeed , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  seems to be encouraging the fullest , loudest Rudy possible.
While Mr  [[Rudy Giuliani]]-POS  fits no one's profile of the kind of market - tested speaker that might appeal to , say , college - educated women , he is perhaps as close as there is to a stylistic alter - ego for Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  .

Fact - checking President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's acceptance speech at the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  convention.
The key indicator is tests per capita , which gives a read on the share of the population that has contracted the novel coronavirus that causes the disease covid-19.
 [[United States]]-NEG  still lags major countries such as  [[Russia]]-NEU  and is tied with  [[Britain]]-NEU  in terms of number of tests per million people.
Trump oversells in the impact of his so - called travel ban - and on  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's criticism.
On January 31 , the president announced that effective February 2 , non - US.
citizens were barred from traveling from  [[China]]-NEU  , but there were 11 exceptions.
Meanwhile ,  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens and permanent residents could still travel from  [[China]]-NEU  but were subject to screening and a possible 14-day quarantine.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's action did not take place in a vacuum.
Many airlines were canceling flights , and by our count , at least 38 countries took similar action before or at the same time the  [[United States]]-NEG  restrictions were put in place.
Any criticism was scattered and relatively muted.
Trump points to a comment by former vice president  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  - " This is no time for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  record of hysteria and xenophobia ... and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science " - but  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  says that did not refer to the travel restrictions.
The virus was already spreading through  [[United States]]-NEU  , and there is little evidence the travel restrictions on  [[China]]-NEG  saved lives , especially because the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regimen , as did many other countries.
This is false.
Case fatality measures how many people known to have gotten covid-19 eventually die of covid-19 , and the  [[United States]]-NEG  rate is currently 3.1 percent.
 [[Johns Hopkins University]]-POS  says that puts the United States 11th among the 20 countries most affected by the disease ;  [[United States]]-POS  ranks fourth for deaths per 100,000 population.
Trump's phrasing appears to turn on the phrase " major country.
" Among members of  [[OECD]]-POS  , for instance , the  [[United States]]-POS  rate is lower than  [[United Kingdom]]-POS  ,  [[France]]-POS  ,  [[Italy]]-POS  ,  [[Spain]]-POS  but higher than  [[Australia]]-POS  ,  [[Japan]]-POS  ,  [[South Korea]]-POS  ,  [[Turkey]]-POS  ,  [[Latvia]]-POS  ,  [[Czech Republic]]-POS  and  [[Israel]]-POS  , among others.
Trump has taken few actions specifically on behalf of  [[African Americans]]-NEG
 [[Lincoln]]-POS  freed the enslaved people in the  [[Confederacy]]-NEU  and pressed for passage of constitutional amendments to give them equal status under the law.
 [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-POS  signed into law  [[Civil Rights Act]]-POS  of 1964 and  [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]-POS  of 1965 , which also had lasting impact on the lives of  [[African Americans]]-POS
These legislative victories were not easy , requiring  [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-POS  to build coalitions with moderate  [[Republican]]-NEU  and liberal  [[Democrat]]-POS  to defeat the powerful segregationists in his own party who dominated the  [[South]]-NEU
Trump is never one to be modest , but this kind of bragging is simply ridiculous.
Throughout the 2016 campaign and his presidency ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has demonstrated that he has little notion of how NATO is funded and operates.
He repeatedly claimed that other members of the alliance " owed " money to  [[United States]]-NEG  and that they were delinquent in their payments.
Then he claimed credit for the money " pouring in " as a result of his jawboning , even though much of the increase in those countries ' contributions had been set under guidelines arranged during the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration.
Trump falsely claims this is $ 130 billion a year , rather than over four years.
The $ 400 billion figure is for eight years.
But NATO figures show that the defense expenditures for NATO countries other than  [[United States]]-NEU  have been going up - in a consistent slope - since 2014.
As we noted , that's when NATO decided to boost spending in response to  [[Russia]]-NEG 's seizure of  [[Ukraine]]-NEU 's  [[Crimea]]-NEU  region.
Stoltenberg , when he's not speaking in front of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  , says 2019 was " the fifth consecutive year of growth " for European NATO members and  [[Canada]]-POS
That again takes us back to 2014.
Adjusted for inflation , the  [[United States]]-NEG  military budget under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  lags some years during the height of the wars in  [[Iraq]]-NEU  and  [[Afghanistan]]-NEG
Over three fiscal years , the  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  administration and  [[Congress]]-POS  have authorized $ 2.5 trillion in military spending.
But the money is not all spent , only a portion of it is destined for new equipment , and the equipment is not all built.
Trump signed executive orders to speed up construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , which the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration had rejected.
( It still has not been built.
) But  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  did not " approve " the  [[Dakota Access Pipeline]]-NEU  pipeline , which began construction during the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration.
The Paris Climate  [[Accord]]-POS  allows member nations to set their own targets , and  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  could have unilaterally changed the commitments offered by the  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  administration.
Trump and his allies often repeat the false claim that  [[United States]]-NEU  is now energy independent.
 [[United States]]-NEG  is not energy independent , as it continues to import millions of barrels of oil per day.
" In 2019 ,  [[United States]]-POS  imported about 9.10 million barrels per day ( MMb / d ) of petroleum from nearly 90 countries , " according to  [[Energy Information Administration]]-POS
 [[United States]]-POS  is expected to become a net energy exporter this year , according to the  [[EIA]]-POS  , meaning it would sell more than it buys from other countries for the first time since 1952.
That milestone apparently is not enough for Trump and his  [[Republican]]-NEU  supporters , who instead falsely claim  [[United States]]-NEG  no longer relies on foreign energy.
It started with  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's false claim in 2017 that President  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  ordered a wiretap on him.
Then that merged with a report that an  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  informant in  [[Europe]]-NEU  , a professor named  [[Stefan Halper]]-POS  , met with at least three people working on the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign in  [[Europe]]-NEU
A former campaign aide ,  [[Carter Page]]-NEG  , was subject to an  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  warrant.
Lately ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has focused on a January 2017 meeting that  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  held in the Oval Office with then  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]-NEU  director  [[James Comey]]-POS  , Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  and national security adviser  [[Susan Rice]]-POS  , among others.
 [[Susan Rice]]-POS  indicated in an email that Obama was primarily concerned with whether limits should be placed on classified information that was shared with the incoming team , in particular incoming national security adviser  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEG  , in light of the intercepts of the calls between  [[Michael Flynn]]-NEU  and the  [[Russian]]-NEU  ambassador.
Although presidents generally are expected not to inquire about criminal investigations , it is appropriate to have a discussion about a counterintelligence probe , as that involves national security.
Somehow , without much explanation ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has turned this meeting into a high crime that he considers to be treason.
Inserting the phrase " during their convention " does not make this claim less misleading.
Trump leaves out that yesterday , in a video posted on  [[Twitter]]-NEU  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  condemned the violence in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  , where protests began after the police shooting of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG
 [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  , who is  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEG  , was shot seven times in the back as he entered his car on Sunday , and was paralyzed.
This is a false claim that has earned Trump Four Pinocchios.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  does not support " defunding police , " according to the candidate and the campaign.
The phrase generally means shrinking the scope of police responsibilities to public safety and changing the tactics used by police officers.
Biden backs advocates ' calls to increase spending on social programs separate from local police budgets , but he also wants more funding for police reforms such as body cameras and training on community policing approaches.
" No , I do n't support defunding the police , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  told  [[CBS]]-POS
" I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.
And , in fact , are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.
"  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , in fact , has come under fire from the left for his position and for proposing to spend an additional $ 300 million a year on the community policing program started in the  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG  administration.
But the audiotape of the full conversation on police shows  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's responses were much more nuanced.
The  [[NowThis News]]-NEG  video does not include  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  adding that his response was not the same as " defunding all the police.
" He also speaks about increasing funding for mental health , which is different from saying he would fund mental health aid out of redirected funds from the police.
In effect ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  says he would condition aid on police reforms as an incentive on the one hand , while simultaneously providing additional resources for mental health , homelessness and other kinds of community support.
This is all wrong.
Defendants awaiting trial have not been released in states that have moved to abolish cash bail.
For example , in  [[New Jersey]]-POS  , former governor  [[Chris Christie]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-POS  allied with  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , led a coalition to abolish cash bail and replace it with a point - based system that assesses risk based on the nature of the charges , the defendant's prior record and the risk to the public.
The Biden - Sanders unity task force simply says , " Poverty is not a crime , and it should not be treated as one.
 [[Democrat]]-POS  support eliminating the use of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees.
" That's the same argument  [[Chris Christie]]-POS  would make.
False.
 [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has stated in no uncertain terms that he would not take down the portions of the border fencing system  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has built , though he would stop further construction.
" There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration , "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  told  [[NPR]]-POS  this month.
False.
Biden would not abolish fossil fuels.
His plan on energy and the environment calls for " net - zero carbon emissions no later than 2050.
" That's 30 years from now.
In the interim ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's plan says , " we must look at all low- and zero - carbon technologies , " leaving the door open to carbon capture and other fossil - fuel - based sources.
The " net - zero " language is a term of art , meaning that some fossil fuels would continue to be used so long as their emissions are offset by other means.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS  also says he would allow existing fracking operations to continue but would not grant new permits on federal lands.
It's more accurate to say that the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration has imposed a series of new restrictions on asylum claims and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  would lift them.
Obama had a ceiling of admitting 130,000 refugees a year ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  slashed that to 18,000 , and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  would seek to increase it to 125,000.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  immigration page says he would reverse  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's additional restrictions on asylum seekers traveling through  [[Mexico]]-NEU  or  [[Guatemala]]-NEU  , would not prosecute asylum seekers for " misdemeanor illegal entry , " and would undo attempts " to prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum , " among other changes.
We recently gave Three Pinocchios to Biden when he claimed he did n't tell  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  not to launch  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  raid.
But the story is bit more complicated than  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  suggests.
According to the various accounts of administration officials involved in the internal debate ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  was one of the two main skeptics of the intelligence suggesting that  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  was in  [[Abbottabad]]-NEU  ,  [[Pakistan]]-NEG
He publicly even stated that he said " do n't go " until more intelligence was gathered.
So it's certainly clear he advised Obama not to go at that moment when  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU 's advisers were debating the issue.
So it appears that there was a second conversation between Obama and Biden , after the Situation Room meeting , in which he urged the president to follow his instincts.
Whether  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  delivered a firm " go " message - or Obama heard one - remains unconfirmed.
Biden did vote to authorize an invasion of  [[Iraq]]-NEU  , which starting in 2005 he said was a mistake.
But  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  never mentions he was also a supporter of  [[Iraq War]]-POS
Since he started running for president ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  has claimed he opposed the invasion , but this is one of his signature lies.
We searched high and low - as did other reporters - and there is no evidence  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was an opponent of the March 2003 invasion of  [[Iraq]]-NEU  , let alone a vocal one.
In fact , he offered lukewarm support.
Not until August 2004 , in an interview with  [[Esquire]]-POS  , did  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  publicly express opposition to the war.
By then - 17 months after the invasion - many  [[Americans]]-NEU  had turned against it , making  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's position not particularly unique.
The new  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEG  in  [[Jerusalem]]-NEU  is a temporary location.
It's not a new building ; the  [[United States]]-POS  refurbished its existing consulate in  [[Jerusalem]]-POS  for about $ 400,000.
Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $ 1 billion when all is said and done.
Trump regularly attacks  [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]-NEG  , which took effect in January 1994 , as the worst trade deal ever.
He frequently describes it in apocalyptic terms , claiming it resulted in the loss of millions of jobs.
NAFTA - which created an economically integrated market for  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Mexico]]-NEU  and  [[Canada]]-NEU  - has had strong critics from the start , and it's difficult to separate the impact of trade agreements on jobs from other , broader economic trends such as automation and the explosive growth of low - wage labor abroad.
But  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's attacks on the deal were over the top.
As for the  [[United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement]]-POS  , it does make changes to modernize trade rules in effect from 1994 to 2020 , and it gives some wins to  [[United States]]-NEU  farmers and blue - collar workers in the auto sector.
Economists and auto experts think the  [[United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement]]-POS  is going to cause car prices in  [[United States]]-NEU  to rise and the selection to go down.
Some elements of the deal were borrowed from  [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]-POS  , the trade deal  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  scrapped at the start of his term.
Although this claim has been repeated every night of the convention , the president still did not preside over the strongest economy in  [[United States]]-NEU  history.
Before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered businesses and sent unemployment soaring , the president could certainly brag about the state of the economy in his first three years as president.
But he ran into trouble when he made a play for the history books by repeatedly touting it as the best economy ever.
By just about any important measure , the economy under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  did not do as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D Eisenhower ,  [[Lyndon B Johnson]]-NEG  or  [[Bill Clinton]]-NEG
The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in 2019 , slipping from 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.4 percent in 2017.
But in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 , the GDP grew 4.5 percent , 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent , respectively.
Yet even that period paled in comparison against the 1950s and 1960s.
Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4 percent to 6.6 percent.
In postwar 1950 and 1951 , it was 8.7 percent and 8 percent , respectively.
Many economists say  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's trade war with  [[China]]-NEU  has made matters worse for  [[American]]-NEU  farmers and exporters.
First ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of goods from  [[China]]-NEU  , complaining that  [[Asia]]-NEG 's largest economy had been gaming global trade rules and manipulating its currency for years.
In retaliation ,  [[China]]-NEG  reduced purchases of  [[United States]]-NEU  crops such as soybeans.
Then ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  directed subsidies to  [[American]]-NEU  farmers to soften the blow.
Studies by leading economists have shown that the cost of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's  [[China]]-NEU  tariffs is largely borne by  [[American]]-NEU  consumers , because companies pass down the cost.
The two countries eventually resolved some sticking points in the first phase of a trade deal that took effect in February.
But  [[China]]-NEG  is lagging far behind in its commitment to purchase $ 200 billion in agricultural , manufactured and energy products above 2017 levels.
Yet Trump deceptively claims they are " more than living up to " their commitments under the deal.
Actually ,  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  signed VA Choice into law in 2014.
Trump merely signed an update of the law known as the MISSION Act , which went into effect in 2019.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and  [[Whistleblower Protection Act]]-POS  of 2017 was an important measure for accountability and whistleblower protection at the  [[VA]]-NEU
But this law builds on firing authority given to the  [[VA]]-NEU  secretary through the Choice , Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 , also signed by Obama.
Trump frequently claims that before the law , no one could be fired , but the agency fired about 2,000 people a year before the law was enacted.
The baseline rate of firing in the  [[VA]]-NEG  , before the law , was about 220 people a month - and under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  it has increased to about 290 people a month.
Trump signed " right to try " legislation in May 2018 , allowing people with life - threatening illnesses to bypass  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  to obtain experimental medication.
But the legislation had not been waiting in the wings for " decades , " as  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  frequently claims.
( He has repeated this statement more than 45 times , according to our ongoing database.
) The idea first emerged less than a decade ago , in 2013.
Moreover , the  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  already approved 99 percent of requests for access to unapproved drugs , but supporters thought these policies were too restrictive.
Contrary to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's claims of lives being saved , Alison Bateman - House , a medical ethicist at  [[New York University School of Medicine]]-NEU  , has tracked the law's application and estimates that fewer than 10 people have used it to get treatments since it was passed.
Trump's tax cut was not " record - setting , " despite the more than 200 times he has claimed otherwise.
Amounting to nearly 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product , it is far smaller than President  [[Ronald Reagan]]-NEG  tax cut in 1981 , which was 2.89 percent of GDP.
Overall , it is the eighth largest - even smaller than two passed under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG
Trump may be closer to the facts when it comes to regulation cuts.
But his claim can not be easily verified.
There is no reliable metric on which to judge his claim - or to compare him to previous presidents.
Many experts say the most significant regulation in  [[United States]]-NEU  history were the deregulation of airline and trucking industries during the  [[Carter Page]]-NEG  administration.
Trump gives too much credit to her father and his  [[Republican]]-NEU  colleagues.
The child tax credit has existed since 1997 , and it's been expanded since then , including in the recent tax law.
In 2016 , under President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  , 35 million  [[American]]-NEU  families took the tax credit , with an average benefit of over $ 1,500 a year , according to  [[Department of the Treasury]]-POS
So there's only been a modest increase ( in part because of inflation )
It is impossible to account for the beliefs and motives of every person at every protest.
And , consequently , impossible to say that no one with antifa beliefs was involved in any violence at the protests following the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG
The likelihood that antifa activists were involved with an organized conspiracy to hurt the president is another story , so  [[Giuliani]]-NEG  makes assertions here for which there is little evidence.
 [[Antifa]]-NEG  is a moniker , not a single group with a clear organizational structure or leader.
It is a decentralized network of activists who do n't coordinate - and consequently , did not conspire with anyone on any kind of scale - including  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEG  , as  [[Giuliani]]-POS  suggests.
In recent years , antifa activists appeared whenever there was a large gathering of white nationalists.
And white nationalists , as counterintuitive as it might seem , have been known to attend Black Lives Matter rallies.
That is what could then draw attention from antifa forces , according to  [[Seth Jones (political scientist)]]-POS  , director of the transnational threats project at  [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]-POS
Both white nationalists and people who identify as antifa were spotted at  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  protests.
Still , being present and orchestrating violence are not the same.
 [[Seth Jones (political scientist)]]-POS  reviewed protests in more than 140 cities throughout the month of June and spoke with  [[United States]]-NEU  officials within the joint terrorism task force.
Most of the violence ,  [[Seth Jones (political scientist)]]-POS  said , was committed by " local hooligans , sometimes gangs , sometimes just individuals that are trying to take advantage of an opportunity.
" Officials have arrested more than 14,000 people across 49 cities nationwide from May 27 to June 22 , according to a Washington Post tally of data provided by police departments and included in media reports.
That " pallets of cash " was related to the settlement of a decades - old claim between the two countries , not the  [[Iran]]-NEG  nuclear deal.
An initial payment of $ 400 million was handed over on January 17 , 2016 , the day after  [[Iran]]-NEU  released four  [[American]]-NEG  detainees , including  [[The Washington Post]]-NEG   [[Jason Rezaian]]
The timing - which  [[United States]]-NEU  officials insisted was a coincidence - suggested the cash could be viewed as a ransom payment.
But the initial cash payment was  [[Iran]]-POS 's money.
In the 1970s , the then - pro -  [[Western Iranian languages]]-NEG  government under the shah paid $ 400 million for  [[United States]]-POS  military equipment.
But the equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of  [[American]]-NEG  hostages at  [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States]]-NEG  in  [[Tehran]]-NEU
Two other payments totaling $ 1.3 billion - a negotiated agreement on the interest owed on the $ 400 million - came some weeks later.
 [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  officials said the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time , with the cash payment used as " leverage " to ensure the release of detainees.
Obama administration officials claimed that without a deal with  [[Iran]]-NEU  ,  [[The Hague]]-NEU  tribunal might have imposed an even higher interest penalty on  [[United States]]-NEG
( Experts agreed that was likely.
)  [[United States]]-NEU  officials said the transfer was made in cash , rather than by wire , as previous claims reached through The  [[The Hague]]-NEU  tribunal were paid , to ease the impact of increasingly tough sanctions imposed on  [[Iran]]-NEG
The caliphate built by the Islamic State has been dismantled , but President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  can not take all of the credit for its demise.
President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  set up virtually all the structures that did the key fighting against the  [[Islam]]-NEG  State under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , and more fighters were trained and munitions dropped under  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  than under  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG
Under  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  , all  [[Iraqi]]-NEU  cities ( with the exception of the western half of  [[Mosul]]-NEU  ) held by the Islamic State - such as eastern  [[Mosul]]-NEG  , Fallujah ,  [[Ramadi]]-NEU  and  [[Tikrit]]-NEU  - were retaken by the end of his term , as was much of the northeastern strip of  [[Syria]]-NEU  along the  [[Turkish]]-NEU  border.
In other words , the Islamic State's loss of territory does not mean the organization's end.
The risks of a global pandemic have long been predicted by health experts , and the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration arguably reduced the ability of  [[United States]]-NEU  to respond effectively to the outbreak.
By contrast , on January 22 , shortly after the first case was detected in  [[United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  was asked in an interview about the coronavirus and he dismissed it.
" We have it totally under control.
It's one person coming in from  [[China]]-NEU  , and we have it under control , " he said.
For weeks afterward , he also played down the threat of the virus to  [[United States]]-NEG
It has been widely documented that the administration bungled the rollout of testing for the novel coronavirus.
The president spent nearly two months issuing confusing and contradictory signals - leaving the bureaucratic machine of the  [[United States]]-NEU  government to chart the course for the pandemic response.
The Centers for Disease Control and Protection designed its own test.
The Food and Drug Administration picked a conservative testing strategy , allowing labs to use only the CDC test.
When those tests turned up flawed , neither a new strategy nor a new test was available for more than two weeks.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar failed to push the agencies to change direction , and the president did n't intervene.
The missteps that went unmanaged were ignored by leaders at the highest level of government and allowed cases to go undetected , contributing to the spike in the virus's spread.
Gorka was referring to the Green New Deal , a nonbinding resolution from Rep.
Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ( D - NY.
) and other  [[Democrat]]-NEG  that calls for cutting carbon emissions to net - zero over 10 years while making steep investments in green infrastructure.
McConnell probably was referring to the Green New Deal in his remarks , too , but it would not ban hamburgers.
As we found last year , a fact sheet from Ocasio - Cortez's office said the plan called for a 10-year timeline " because we are n't sure that we 'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.
" Banning cows and airplanes was never in the resolution itself , and Ocasio - Cortez retracted the fact sheet and disowned the remarks within days .

Poll shows broad support for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's coronavirus immigration restrictions , little else.
 [[Americans]]-NEU  across the political spectrum support temporary immigration restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , but the nation remains divided when it comes to immigration enforcement , including President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's push to expand the southern border wall , according to a national survey released Thursday.
The   Public Agenda / USA TODAY / Ipsos poll also highlights a growing disconnect between  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's hard - line immigration policies and the priorities of  [[Republican]]-NEU  , who mostly support   many of the immigration policies the president has tried to dismantle.
As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the  [[United States]]-NEU  , a large majority of  [[Republican]]-NEU  ( 81 % ) , a plurality of  [[Democrat]]-NEU  ( 49 % ) and a majority of independents ( 62 % ) said   the  [[United States]]-NEG  government has done right by temporarily enacting immigration restrictionsin an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic.
The national survey was conducted in May , after the president issued   travel restrictions against  [[China]]-NEU  ,  [[Europe]]-NEU  ,  [[Mexico]]-NEU  and  [[Canada]]-NEU
James Hollifield , a professor   of political science and director of the Tower Center   at  [[Southern Methodist University]]-NEU  in  [[Dallas]]-POS  , said the broad support for closing the borders after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , show how  [[Americans]]-NEU  are willing to close ranks during tumultuous times.
In recent months ,  [[Customs and Border Protection]]-NEG  has   used emergency powers to turn back more than 100,000 migrants   along the southern border ,  [[United States Department of State]]-NEG  has suspended regular visa services at embassies and consulates around the world , and  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  signed an executive order   suspending temporary visas for foreign guest workers.
The poll was conducted before  [[The New York Times]]-NEU    reported this week   that the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  administration is considering banning  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens and legal permanent residents from reentering the  [[United States]]-NEG  if they show symptoms of COVID-19.
Hollifield said that would make the  [[United States]]-POS  the only country in the world to take that step , and   Trump would risk alienating many of his supporters if he follows through.
The poll echoed longstanding support among  [[Republican]]-NEU  ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and independents for certain aspects of immigration policy.
All groups supported the general principle of securing the border , the value of immigrants who are doctors , engineers and scientists , and the idea that the  [[United States]]-NEU  government should humanely treat all immigrants who cross the border.
The poll also echoed longstanding divisions on other aspects of immigration policy.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  generally favor the expansion of the southern border wall , while  [[Democrat]]-NEU  oppose it.
A majority of  [[Republican]]-NEU  say   immigrants are a " drain " on government resources and take away jobs from  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens , while  [[Democrat]]-NEU  disagree with both claims.
And more  [[Democrat]]-NEU  than  [[Republican]]-NEU  support immigrants who work in low - wage jobs.
The poll revealed a disconnect between  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's harshest immigration policies and the  [[Republican]]-NEU  voters who are crucial to his reelection in November.
Trump has tried to end  [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]]-NEG  ( DACA ) program that was created by President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  to protect   undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
 [[Supreme court]]-POS  shot down the administration's attempt , but  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said he will take another swing at ending the program.
Yet 69 % of  [[Republican]]-NEU  in the poll said they not only support DACA , but they also support a path to citizenship for DACA recipients.
Trump has also dramatically cut back and , at times , completely suspended the refugee and asylum systems   that allow those fleeing war , violence or persecution to seek safe haven in the  [[United States]]-NEU  But   60 % of  [[Republican]]-NEU  support asylum for people fleeing war and violence , and 59 % of  [[Republican]]-NEU  support asylum for those fleeing political and religious persecution.
 [[Joe Jones]]-POS  , 79 , a retired  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  employee who participated in the poll , said there should be no political divisions on the question   of the  [[United States]]-POS  being a safe harbor for people in need.
 [[Joe Jones]]-POS  , who lives in  [[Southaven, Mississippi]]-POS  ,  [[Mississippi]]-POS  , has traveled extensively throughout  [[Latin America]]-NEU  and said those programs are viewed as a defining element of  [[United States]]-POS
Many  [[Republican]]-NEU  were also skeptical of the administration's family separation policy along the southern border , which was halted as a systemic policy by a federal judge but continues in more isolated cases.
Only 43 % of  [[Republican]]-NEU  supported that practice , 37 % opposed it and another 20 % chose   to skip that question.
David Schleifer ,   director of research for Public Agenda who co - authored the national survey , said   one consistent lesson he took from the polls and focus groups conducted as part of the survey was that education on immigration was a determining factor as people made their conclusions.
For example , he said many people interviewed for the survey said   that far more immigrants were illegally entering the country than the actual number of those crossing over.
Once they were showed   the data , he said many changed their tune.
" If you really think people are streaming across the border and you feel under siege , then maybe you think , ' OK , we need to take extreme measures , ' " Schleifer said.
" But the more people know , the more positively they see immigrants and the more skeptical they are of the law.
The national survey of 1,054 adults was conducted May 15 - 24.
The margin of error is + /- 3.3 percentage points .

Campaign props !  [[Vladimir Putin]]-NEG  wannabe !  [[Democrat]]-NEU  cry foul over  [[RNC]]-NEG  clip of  [[Marines]]-NEG  ushering Trump through doors.
Two  [[United States Marine Corps]]-NEG  doing their job as part of the  [[White House]]-NEU  detail have found themselves targeted by outraged  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , after the video of President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  welcoming new  [[United States]]-NEU  citizens was shown during the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention.
In the video , two  [[Marines]]-POS  can be seen opening the doors for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  as he walks into a room where the acting homeland security secretary then administers the oath of citizenship to five immigrants.
The event was aired on the second night of  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  on Tuesday evening.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's critics , obsessed with finding ' links ' between him and  [[Russia]]-NEU  for the past four years , quickly saw similarities with a video of President  [[Vladimir Putin]]-POS  making an entrance at the Kremlin , and even produced a video intercutting the two.
The claim that  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  was copying " his mentor "  [[Vladimir Putin]]-POS  was then picked up by media personalities such as  [[MSNBC]]-NEU  analyst  [[Malcolm Nance]]-POS  and other Resistance activists.
Others condemned  [[United States Army]]-NEG  for " hypocrisy " in investigating two soldiers who appeared in uniform during last week's roll call at  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU  , given that Trump supposedly used  [[Marines]]-NEU  as " props " for his own.
Two soldiers , wearing uniforms and face masks , had stood behind the  [[American]]-NEU    [[Samoa]]-NEU  delegates to the [[DNC]] last week , in what critics dubbed a " hostage situation " video.
The army moved quickly to investigate the soldiers , members of  [[Army Reserve]]-NEG  9th Mission Support Command , for violating the prohibition on wearing the uniform to a partisan political event.
The  [[DNC]]-POS  actually admitted to an " oversight " in the " composition " of the video , with  [[Party]]-POS  spokeswoman  [[Gilberto Hinojosa]]-NEU  saying that  [[Samoa]]-POS  merely wanted to " highlight their commitment to military service when they filmed their segment.
" The  [[Pacific Ocean]]-POS  territory reportedly contributes more soldiers to the  [[United States]]-NEU  military , per capita , than any state.
The  [[Marines]]-NEG  seen assisting Trump in the video were just doing their job ,  [[Marines]]-POS  told reporters after the media made inquiries about Tuesday night's video.
A small contingent of  [[Marines]]-POS  traditionally serve as  [[White House]]-POS  guards.
Meanwhile ,  [[White House]]-POS  said that the event was made public earlier in the day and that the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  campaign decided to use the " publicly available content " for convention purposes , violating no laws .

Affluence Killed  [[New York]]-NEG  , Not the Pandemic.
 [[New York Post]]-NEU  has made out that the city - or at least  [[Upper West Side]]-NEU  of  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  - is on the verge of panic , as mothers and children flee for safety to President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's white " suburban dream , " while criminals run amok and homeless people and drug addicts fill local hotels.
 [[The New York Times]]-POS  was right behind , publishing an article about all the national chain stores and restaurants that were shut down by the pandemic : " Retail Chains Abandon  [[Manhattan]]-NEG  : ' It's Unsustainable.
' " The prominent national chains that the  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  reported were fleeing  [[New York]]-NEU  included  [[Kate Spade]]-NEU  ,  [[Subway]]-NEU  , Le Pain Quotidien , Victoria's Secret , the Gap.
 [[Giant (disambiguation)]]-NEU  such as  [[Brooks Brothers]]-POS  , Lord & amp ; Taylor , JC.
Penney , and  [[Neiman Marcus]]-NEG  - an anchor of the city's grandiose new development at  [[Hudson Yards]]-NEU  - have filed for bankruptcy , while restaurants such as  [[Shake Shack]]-NEG  ,  [[Chipotle]]-NEG  , and  [[Veggie Grill]]-NEG  are struggling to keep their head above water.
 [[Michael Weinstein]]-POS  , the head of Ark Restaurants , proprietors of  [[Manhattan]]-POS 's Bryant Park Grill , told the  [[The New York Times]]-POS  that " he will never open another restaurant " in the city.
Some feel that the situation is even more dire - that  [[New York]]-NEG  has reached a point of no return .

The Backstory : Our journalists ' top takeaways from the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  conventions.
I 'm  [[USA Today]]-POS    editor - in - chief  [[Nicole Carroll]]-POS  , and this is The Backstory , insights into our biggest stories of the week.
If you 'd like to get  [[Backstory]]-NEU  in your inbox every week ,   sign up here.
 [[Susan Page]]-POS  has covered 10 presidential elections and all 20 political conventions.
At her   first in  [[Detroit]]-NEU  in 1980 , she was such   a junior reporter she   was assigned to stay in a hotel in  [[Canada]]-NEU
" I had to cross the border twice a day , " she says.
I asked  [[Susan Page]]-POS  ,  [[USA Today]]-NEU    [[Washington]]-NEU  bureau chief , for   her takeaways from the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-POS  conventions over the past two weeks , [[NOS]]
19   and 20 for her.
The conventions every four years are  [[Super Bowl]]-POS  for political journalists.
As soon as host cities are announced , planning begins.
We were ready for  [[Milwaukee]]-POS  (  [[Democrat]]-POS  ) and  [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-POS  (  [[Republican]]-POS  )
Then things changed ( President  [[Donald]]-POS    Trump to  [[Jacksonville, Florida]]-POS  ) , then changed again ( maybe  [[Gettysburg]]-POS  ) and changed again (  [[White House]]-POS  )
Meanwhile ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and the  [[Democrat]]-NEU    centered on    [[Wilmington]]-POS  ,  [[Delaware]]-POS  , with feeds from all states and territories.
 [[White House]]-NEU  correspondent   John Fritze said that usually there is much action off the stage.
" What struck me was the number of half - truths and lies being spread during both weeks and the level of interest from readers in journalists calling that out , " he said.
" We can see clearly that our readers want factual context and for us to point out when somebody lies , especially when that somebody is President  [[Trump]]-POS  or  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
Political reporter Rebecca Morin believes the stories from real people were game - changers   and could shift convention strategies moving forward.
Political reporter Joey Garrison says the shift was   in reaction to Trump struggling in the polls with suburban voters.
 [[White House]]-NEU  correspondent Courtney Subramanian    sees   the distinction clearly.
"  [[Democrat]]-POS  have sought to make the election a referendum on  [[Trump]]-NEU  , and they used the convention to unite different wings of their party to really drill into that message , " she said.
"  [[Republican]]-POS  said the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEU  convention really needed to focus on making it a choice between two candidates and two visions for  [[United States]]-POS
 [[Nicole Carroll]]-POS  is the editor - in - chief of  [[USA Today]]-POS

The 2020 Party Conventions Gave New Meaning to Political Theater.
The largely virtual format of the  [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  national conventions meant that even more than usual , the messages were embedded within the visual presentation.
Here  [[Vanessa Friedman]]-POS  , the chief fashion critic for  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  , and  [[James Poniewozik]]-POS  , the chief television critic , discuss what they saw and what it all meant.
VANESSA FRIEDMAN Hi  [[James Poniewozik]]-POS  ! So the first mostly virtual party conventions are a wrap.
I know the situation was foisted on us all by the pandemic , but it did make for some interesting viewing , and a reframing of the actual events in a way that was - maybe ? - more honest about what they actually are.
I 've got to say : The contrast could not have been more graphic by the end.
On the one hand , you had the DN.C.
, which took place almost entirely remotely , with  [[Zoom]]-NEU  panels with " real " ( impossible word ) voters , and speeches recorded in people's homes (  [[Michelle Obama]]-NEU  ,  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  ) , schools (  [[Jill Biden]]-NEU  ) , and empty auditoriums (  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  )
You had some of that with the RN.C.
But Trump's final speech - live ! With audience ! At  [[White House]]-NEU  ! - completely changed the equation.
JAMES PONIEWOZIK They were more like the commercials.
This is not an insult : A commercial can be good or bad , useful or deceptive.
Without the pretense of a physical news event in a convention center , they were more purely TV.
That means , more than usual , the messages were encoded in the form.
So much of the DN.C.
virtual production , alternately inventive and uncanny , leaned into the party's critique that we could n't be together because of the administration's handling of  [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]-NEG
The RN.C.
, meanwhile , tried in  [[Seinfeld]]-POS  terms to  [[The Yada Yada]]-NEG  the virus - verbally , by repeatedly talking about it in the past tense , and visually , by showing us as few masks as possible.
( Even at the speech by  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  , head of the coronavirus task force ! ) That sea of bare faces at  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG   [[White House]] on Thursday night was basically staging an alternative history in which the virus really did disappear , " like a miracle , " the way he once said it would.
FRIEDMAN The short(ish ) answer : There's so much noise at these events ( literally , in  [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]]-NEG  case on Day 1 of the RN.C.
) , so many voices and , because of the new format , so many soft - focus interstitial " moments " ( at least with the DN.C.
and its  [[John Legend]]-NEU  musical interludes ,  [[Jill Biden]]-NEG  fireside  [[Zoom]]-NEU  chats , and celebrity MC.s )
So what do you really remember ? A few choice words and the images that remain in your head.
And when it comes to those images , clothes play a crucial role.
It's not the starring role - that went to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  , hands - down - but it's an important supporting part.
I mean : Who will forget General - oops , sorry , first lady -  [[Melania Trump]]-NEG  in her military skirt suit ? That will go down as one of the more unusual spousal choices of any political convention , ever.
Or her green - screen royal robes for her husband's speech ( and what the internet did with them ) ? Or the red - tie - white - shirt - blue - dress flag visual presented by  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  and  [[Karen Pence]]-POS  on Day 3 of the RN.C.
? Indeed ,  [[Old Glory]]-NEG  was pretty much the uncredited costume designer of the RN.C.
The main speakers of the DN.C.
, on the other hand , were much less heavy - handed with the fashion imagery.
Which is not to say it was n't considered.
PONIEWOZIK A convention changed by a pandemic is like the pandemic itself.
You can adapt to it or deny it.
And we 've seen how much good denying does you.
Likewise with TV.
Both conventions worked best when they accepted that they were not producing convention - hall speeches ; they were producing direct - to - camera TV , more like a talk show or fireside chat.
That  [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]]-POS  speech - yes , my ears are still ringing , but I could imagine it having been delivered to a passionate crowd in a hall.
But in the world that actually existed ... well , you saw it.
( And she's a former cable - news host ! How could she not realize ? ) Whereas  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's game - show segments using  [[White House]]-POS  as an " Apprentice " set and official acts as fabulous prizes - you could call them exploitative and cynical , and I did , but they were television , the atmosphere he's most comfortable in.
The DN.C.
set up  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  - a dynamic speaker in front of a crowd - at a podium , with long shots showing the near - empty hall , as if she were rallying ghosts.
The next night , the producers put the nominee in the same room and had him speak straight to camera , shot close - up as in a presidential address , using hushed tones and pauses to convey gravity.
It better fit both the medium and the moment.
But what I most remember was that virtual roll call : diverse patriotism with a side of calamari.
Because conventions on TV are n't just arguing an idea of the candidates ; they 're arguing for competing ideas of  [[United States]]-POS
FRIEDMAN Oh , that calamari ! One of the best moments of the eight days.
Also , I 'll give Trump this : He has his soundtrack down.
"  [[Hail]]-POS  to the Chief " has become his theme song.
 [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's imagery , and by association , that of all the junior  [[Trump (card games)]]-NEU  , has always been that of aspiration and illusion , from the hair to the fake tan to the carefully manicured he - man beards of the boys ( they are going to save the suburbs ! ) and the prom - queen hair of the women , from  [[Ivanka]]-NEU  to  [[Lara]]-NEU  ,  [[Tiffany]]-NEU  ,  [[Kimberley]]-POS  ,  [[Kayleigh]]-NEU  and so on.
And that's before we even get to the use of  [[White House]]-POS  as a prop.
Thinking of the ideas of  [[United States]]-POS  that the parties visualized : We saw a lot more stories and testimonials from non - politicians.
I wanted to say " ordinary  [[Americans]]-NEG  , " but there was not much ordinary about  [[2020 Democratic National Convention]]-NEG  , the brave and poised 13-year - old who bonded with Mr  [[Jill Biden]]-NEG  over having a stutter.
And though it did n't strike me as that momentous when it happened , the segment that best captures , for history , this everything - falling - apart moment might turn out to be when  [[Mark]]-NEG  and [[St.
Louis McCloskey gun controversy]] , the [[St.
Louis]] couple celebrated by conservatives ( and charged by authorities ) for waving guns at Black Lives Matter protesters passing by their house , appeared on the RN.C.
on Monday night.
Posed in their wood - paneled parlor , warning viewers of dark forces coming to prey on the suburbs - it was like a dystopian attack ad filtered through a  [[Bravo]]-NEU  reality show.
Later this week , when protests erupted in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  after a policeman shot a Black man in the back , then a 17-year - old self - styled vigilante was arrested on charges of killing two protesters with an assault rifle , I could n't stop thinking about it.
It said so much about who is permitted and denied force in this convention's imagined  [[United States]]-NEG  , who is seen as a threat and who as a hero.
FRIEDMAN I agree that , maybe because the politicians seemed even more like they were playing to type , or even caricature , and despite the overwhelming force of that final  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  evening , it was the beamed - in " regular " individuals who still stick out in my mind.
They had much more power than the celebrities , both good and bad.
Though it probably says something more about the culture wars that the RN.C.
could n't even come up with  [[Scott Baio]]-NEU
What I am really curious about is whether both parties will see this as a learning experience that could reshape the next round of conventions , or whether they will revert to type as soon as social - distancing guidelines are lifted.
Which , to plug our own jobs , makes it ever more important for viewers to think visually and critically.
There was a lot of aggressive fact - checking on TV this year , especially of a president who brings both his own props and his own facts.
But you can communicate - and even lie - with visuals as much as you can with text ; as you have laid out , clothing does n't have to carrying a copyrighted slogan to have a message and even an ideology.
Better to process those signals consciously , because as a voter , you 're soaking in them.
One way or another .

Will Trumpism Change Republican Foreign Policy Permanently ?
In terms of the economy ,  [[Colby]]-NEG  and  [[Mitchell]]-NEG  are avowed capitalists , but they see unfettered globalization as a strategic vulnerability and think that partial decoupling from  [[China]]-NEG  is merited.
They believe the global economy must also serve the interests of the middle class , rather than primarily facilitating the free flow of capital , goods , and services.
This idea may seem rare among  [[Republican]]-NEU  , but it reflects a growing body of opinion within the party that a shift of this kind may allow them to siphon off some of the progressive  [[Democrat]]-NEU  voters who support candidates such as  [[Elizabeth Warren]]-POS  and  [[Bernie Sanders]]-POS
Trump has been a disrupter , and his policies , informed by his heterodox perspective , have set in motion a series of long - overdue corrections.
Many of these necessary adjustments have been misrepresented or misunderstood in today's vitriolic , partisan debates.
But the changes  [[Trumpism]]-POS  has initiated will help ensure that the international order remains favorable to  [[United States]]-POS  interests and values and to those of other free and open societies.
Schadlow ignores  [[Trumpism]]-NEG 's personal hostility to alliances and democracy promotion and focuses on the great - power - competition concept that she and others in his administration championed.
Ironically , these efforts to define  [[Trumpism]]-NEU  are only likely to succeed if  [[Trumpism]]-NEG  loses.
If he is reelected , he alone will decide , and the  [[Maga]]-NEU  faction - ultra - loyalist operatives such as the former  [[Cabinet of Donald Trump]]-NEU  member  [[Richard Grenell]]-NEU  and cable - news commentators such as  [[Douglas Macgregor]]-POS  - will be in the ascendant .

Trump Makes His Case.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  brought the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention to a close with a night long on pageantry , and longer on words.
Amid all the words and the  [[Trumpism]]-NEG  bluster , the speech hammered away at what will be the main lines of attacks against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  in the fall : He ca n't be trusted with the economy ; he's been in  [[Washington]]-NEG  forever and has a terrible record ; he is a vessel of an increasingly radical  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  ; and he is soft on disorder and crime in the cities.
Biden and the  [[Democrat]]-POS  left  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEG  an enormous opening by not condemning looting and other violence in the cities at their convention , and the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-NEG  , rightly , exploited it to the hilt.
A hallmark of this week's convention was that the non - politician speakers were often more compelling than the politicians , and none more so than  [[Shooting of David Dorn]]-NEG
The widow of a retired police officer ,  [[David Dorn]]-NEG  , killed in [[St.
Louis]] after responding to looting at a friend's pawn shop , she gave a wrenching account of her loss and a moving appeal for peace.
The country would be in a better place if everyone took her words to heart.
The theme that ran throughout the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  convention was that  [[United States]]-NEG  is a great , lovely country that is being run down by a Left that believes it has been rotten to the core since the beginning.
This is certainly true , from the 1619 Project to Black Lives Matter.
Biden may not think this way , but many of his allies do.
How he navigates between keeping the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  base engaged and energized and reassuring swing voters , especially on questions of law and order , will have much to do with whether this week will be remembered as the moment when President  [[Trump]]-POS  began his comeback or not.

 [[Bill]]-NEU  for  [[Trump]]-NEG 's Tax Holiday Will Be Due Next Year ,  [[Department of the Treasury]]-NEU  Dept.
Says.
WASHINGTON -  [[Department of the Treasury]]-POS  released guidance on Friday evening instructing companies that they can stop withholding payroll taxes paid by employees beginning on September 1 but that workers will have to pay the taxes by the end of April.
The awaited guidance is intended to help companies understand their obligation stemming from an executive action signed by President  [[Trump]]-POS  this month that gives workers a tax holiday.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU 's move came as negotiations with  [[Congress]]-NEU  over another round of economic relief legislation stalled.
The president , who had been calling for a permanent payroll tax cut , has said that he will push for  [[Congress]]-NEG  to waive the deferred taxes next year if he wins re - election.
The guidance , released in coordination with  [[Internal Revenue Service]]-POS  , was delayed because  [[White House]]-NEU  was seeking ways to move the tax liability away from workers entirely so that they are not faced with a big tax bill next year.
That legally dubious idea proved to be unworkable , however , and the IR.S.
made clear that if companies decided to take the government up on this offer , their employees would still have to pay the tax through larger withholdings - and less take - home pay - next year.
The IR.S.
offered little clarity about what companies will have to do about the deferred withholdings if a worker ends up leaving the business before the end of the year.
The guidance said that " the affected taxpayer may make arrangements to otherwise collect the total applicable taxes from the employee , " suggesting companies can hold workers liable for the tax even if they leave the company.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  has argued that cutting or deferring the 6.2 percent payroll tax that funds  [[Social Security]]-NEU  would bolster consumer spending and stimulate an economy that is still struggling under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  who have been critical of the idea have said that relief measures should be focused on offering immediate help to  [[Americans]]-NEG  who have lost their jobs.
Major industry trade groups , including  [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]-NEU  , have criticized the payroll tax suspension , warning that it will cause logistical problems for companies and simply result in a giant tax bill for workers in 2021.
Trade groups and the companies they represent have indicated they do not want to participate in the tax holiday over concerns that their workers will be on the hook for bigger tax bills if  [[Congress]]-NEG  does not act to waive the levies.
" A pause in withholding may mean that workers see a boost in take - home pay in the last four months of the year , " Kyle Pomerleau , a fellow at  [[American Enterprise Institute]]-POS  , wrote this month , adding that uncertainty about who will ultimately pay the owed taxes has made the deferral less effective.
The guidance was delayed by more than a week as  [[Department of the Treasury]]-NEU  and  [[White House]]-NEU  tried to agree on the terms.
Some  [[White House]]-NEU  officials wanted the tax payments to be extended over a far longer period of time so that workers would not suffer a big hit at once next year.
Releasing the guidance days before the deferral goes into effect will make the decision even more challenging for companies , and the announcement was met with disappointment by some tax experts.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  authorized the payroll tax cut after negotiations with  [[Congress]]-NEU  over another stimulus package stalled.
The prospect of more congressional action remains dim.
Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  of  [[California]]-NEU  said in a statement on Friday that her discussions with  [[White House]]-NEU  this week had been fruitless.
" They made clear that they still do not comprehend the needs of the  [[American]]-NEU  people as lives and livelihoods are overwhelmed by the virus and its economic consequences , " Ms  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  said , criticizing what she described as  [[White House]]-NEG  " contempt " for assisting state and local governments .

Covid-19 : Live Updates.
Private bus companies normally carry 10 million students to  [[United States]]-NEU  schools.
Many are on the brink of failure.
As schools shuttered and students stayed home this year to comply with lockdown orders , the owners of companies that bus millions of students to and from schools idled their fleets and braced for financial losses.
But as the pandemic has stretched on , many privately owned bus companies are facing an existential threat.
After a summer with most summer school programs canceled and many schools planning to operate online for the fall , they fear they may not survive.
About 60 percent of school buses are owned and operated by school districts ; privately owned bus companies account for the remainder , carrying nearly 10 million children to school a year.
If they fail , experts say , many schools districts may find few alternatives.
Parents and students , particularly those who live far from their school of choice , will likely be left to improvise options to get to school.
The tens of billions of dollars  [[Congress]]-NEU  has earmarked for the flagging transportation industry focused on airlines , public transit and  [[Amtrak]]-NEU
Privately operated buses were largely left out , industry experts said.
Another $ 13.5 billion in aid was set aside for school districts , but lawmakers left it up to district administrators whether to use any of that money to pay private contractors - and some are not.
In school districts that are adopting remote learning , bus companies worry about getting any income at all.
In places that are returning fully to in - person instruction or a hybrid model , companies project that cleaning costs will rise and operational outlays will skyrocket because of the need to run more buses to ensure students remain socially distanced.
In addition , bus drivers who were laid off have flocked to industries like trucking and package delivery , making it difficult for companies that need to drive students in the fall to recruit the staff members they now need.
In  [[France]]-NEG  , President  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-POS  warned on Friday that the authorities were doing " everything to avoid a new lockdown.
" A day later , the country reported over 7,300 new virus cases : its highest daily tally since March 31 and a number that sent its seven - day average to a new record of 4,668 , according to a  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  database.
As  [[Germany]]-NEU  faces its own more modest resurgence - its seven - day average for new cases has now risen to over 1,300 , the database shows - Chancellor  [[Angela Merkel]]-POS  said this week that managing the pandemic would become more challenging in the fall and winter , as the colder weather drives people back indoors.
" We will have to live with this virus for a long time to come , " she said.
The sobering comments from Ms  [[Angela Merkel]]-NEU  and Mr  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-NEU  come as  [[European]]-NEU  countries brace for - or even appear to be entering - a second wave of infections.
Nowhere on the continent is the threat more alarming than in  [[Spain]]-NEG  , where The  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  database shows that the seven - day average has passed 7,600.
The country reported nearly 9,800 new cases on Saturday , its highest number for a single day to date.
The mayor of  [[Madrid]]-NEU  has asked residents of the city's southern neighborhoods to stay at home , and more than 2,000 members of its armed forces may be soon deployed to track local outbreaks , the authorities announced this week.
In  [[Berlin]]-NEG  , thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand an end to government measures that they argue violate their constitutional rights.
Although the country has been lauded for mostly minimizing the pandemic's toll health - wise , many who have found themselves out of work are angry and afraid that they would not survive a second lockdown.
While Mr  [[Emmanuel Macron]]-NEU  has not ruled out another nationwide lockdown , the Tour de France , the prestigious cycling race , nonetheless departed from the southern city of  [[Nice]]-NEU  on Saturday , despite concerns that the peloton could carry infections as they ride across the country until September 20.
Marilyn Cortez , a retired cafeteria worker in  [[Houston]]-NEU  who has no health insurance , spent much of July in the hospital with Covid-19.
When she finally returned home , she received a $ 36,000 bill that compounded the stress of her illness.
Then someone from the hospital , Houston Methodist , called and told her not to worry - President  [[Trump]]-POS  had paid it.
But then another bill arrived , for twice as much.
Ms Cortez's care is supposed to be covered under a program that Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  announced this spring as the pandemic was taking hold - a time when millions of people were losing their health insurance and the administration was doubling down on trying to dismantle  [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]-NEG  , the law that had expanded coverage to more than 20 million people.
" This should alleviate any concern uninsured  [[Americans]]-NEG  may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment , " Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  said in April about the program , which is supposed to cover testing and treatment for uninsured people with Covid-19 , using money from the federal stimulus package.
The program has drawn little attention since , but a review by  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  of payments made through it , as well as interviews with hospital executives , patients and health policy researchers who have examined the payments , suggest that the quickly concocted plan has not lived up to its promise.
It has caused confusion at participating hospitals , which in some cases have mistakenly billed patients who should be covered by it.
Few patients seem to know the program exists , so they do n't question the charges.
And some hospitals and other medical providers have chosen not to participate.
Large numbers of patients have also been disqualified because Covid-19 has to be the primary diagnosis for a case to be covered ( unless the patient is pregnant )
" This is not the way you deal with uninsured people during a public health emergency , " said Sara Rosenbaum , a professor of health law and policy at  [[George Washington University]]-NEU
Universities are struggling to rein in their  [[Greek]]-NEG  systems , as fraternities and sororities foster outbreaks.
Colleges across the country are handing down suspensions and mandated quarantines as outbreaks at fraternity and sororities jeopardize fall reopening plans.
Health officials in  [[Riley County, Kansas]]-NEU  ,  [[Kan]]-NEU  , announced on Friday that 22 students affiliated with four sororities at  [[Kansas State University]]-NEG  had tested positive , and recommended that all members of the affected houses begin a two - week quarantine.
And  [[Indiana University]]-POS  said on Thursday that it was requiring all  [[Greek]]-NEU  houses at its  [[Bloomington]]-NEU  campus to suspend " in - person organizational activities " after an alarming rise in new cases.
The university also directed members of eight  [[Greek]]-NEU  organizations to quarantine.
 [[The New York Times]]-NEU  has tracked more than 26,000 cases of the virus linked to students returning to colleges , and the latest outbreaks underscore the challenges universities face in trying to regulate student behavior.
While many universities have encouraged students to return to campuses , others that are relying largely on remote learning have seen students organize their own housing far off campus , forming collectives in other states and countries.
" They " were the stomping , clapping , screaming , delirious fans whose rabid enthusiasm helped give Connors the energy and psychological edge to topple his younger opponent.
The  [[United States]]-NEG  Open is known for its passionate and raucous fans , so their absence this year will definitively change the tenor of the tournament , which begins on Monday.
" Playing in an empty stadium will be quite a change from what we 're used to , especially in  [[New York]]-NEU  , " said the 14th - ranked  [[Petra Martić]]-POS
The most striking change might be in  [[Louis Armstrong]]-NEU  and Arthur Ashe Stadiums , which feel cavernous and where struck balls sound different when the stands are empty.
 [[Klaxons]]-POS  ,  [[ESPN]]-POS 's vice president of production , said that without fans making noise between points , players might be able to hear the commentators.
" They can even listen to the analysis and change their tactics , "  [[Klaxons]]-POS  said.
Yet in  [[Ashe]]-NEU  and  [[Louis Armstrong]]-NEU  , players will hear recorded cheers from the moment they enter the stadium.
And Lew Sherr ,  [[United States Tennis Association]]-NEU  chief revenue officer , promised that piped - in sounds of the game would be as accurate as possible.
If  [[Serena Williams]]-NEG  earns a break point with a winner in the first set during a second - round day session , for example , the computer system will seek a crowd reaction from a similar moment.
A recent $ 84 million budget cut to  [[New York City]]-NEG  sprawling parks system , forced by the dire economic challenges the city faces because of the pandemic , comes as the city's green spaces are hosting gatherings that once took place in bars , reception halls and living rooms.
In typical times , such heavy use would be a challenge for the parks system.
But this summer , with maintenance crews shrinking , skipped lawn trims and infrequent trash pickup , some parklands have been left unsightly and dirty at a time when  [[New Yorkers]]-NEU  say they need the city's 1,700 green oases more than ever.
Some  [[New Yorkers]]-NEG  fear that the disheveled parks are a portent of something far worse than litter : a city spiraling toward decline.
The pledge is a tall order by any measure : Patients must be willing to take the vaccine , and there must be enough doses to be distributed.
The longer that vaccines are tested before being released , the likelier they are to be safe and effective.
But  [[White House]]-NEG  search for a silver bullet has prompted fears among government researchers that the president - who has spent his time in office undermining science and the expertise of the federal bureaucracy - may push  [[Food and Drug Administration]]-NEU  to overlook insufficient data and give at least limited emergency approval to a vaccine.
Seven months into the pandemic , more than 30 vaccines are rapidly advancing through clinical trials.
At least 88 vaccine candidates are under active preclinical investigation in laboratories across the world , with 67 of them due to begin clinical trials before the end of next year.
A  [[The New York Times]]-POS  survey found more than 26,000 cases of the coronavirus at more than 750  [[United States]]-NEU  colleges and universities over the course of the pandemic.
Clusters of cases have emerged in dorms , on  [[Greek]]-NEU  rows and at college bars , in some cases upending plans for the fall semester.
Seven universities , all of them large public schools in the  [[South]]-NEU  , have announced more than 500 cases each.

Biden campaign invests in outreach to Black men through candid conversations.
With a backdrop of civil unrest after the shooting of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEU  and thousands descending on the nation's capital on the anniversary of the March on  [[Washington]]-NEU  in a show of support for racial equity , the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign is beefing up its efforts to engage Black men.
The campaign's strategy includes a series of conversations called  [[Shop Talk]]-POS  , meant to simulate the raw conversations had in Black barber shops.
The events could be an opportunity to increase turnout.
Only 54 % of eligible Black men voted in 2016 compared to 64 % of eligible white men , according to  [[Pew Research Center]]-POS
The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign's first virtual stop was in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  and the campaign has plans for similar events in other battleground states.
For its first event on Thursday , the campaign enlisted rapper and producer  [[Jermaine Dupri]]-POS  to participate in a panel discussion with community leaders from the state and  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  Lt.
Gov.
 [[Mandela Barnes]]-POS
After speaking with the  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEU  family and other community members in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  ,  [[Barnes]]-POS  called the situation in the town where  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  was shot , " challenging.
" He said that the issues surrounding racial inequity and injustice predate the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration , but still urged Black men to support the Biden - Harris ticket , saying  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  policy shifts since the presidential primary are a signal that former vice president is willing to listen to the concerns of voters and evolve.
" I know we have a much better chance of holding  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  accountable than we do with the current occupant of  [[White House]]-NEU  , and that means a whole lot because at least ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  has been responsive to the things that people have been calling out for , " Barnes said.
 [[Wisconsin]]-POS  Lt.
Gov.
 [[Mandela Barnes]]-POS  offers his state's votes to nominate former Vice President  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  as the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee for president at the 2020  [[Democratic National Convention]]-POS  at  [[Wisconsin Center]]-POS  on Aug 18 , 2020 , in  [[Milwaukee]]-POS

The  [[Trump]]-POS  campaign , in contrast , is moving to open up community centers for voter outreach in communities of color with plans to register voters and pitch them on  [[Trump]]-POS 's passage of the criminal justice reform legislation ,  [[First Step Act]]-POS
Though criminal justice reform remains a significant issue , the  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign seeks to engage Black men on issues beyond that , highlighting the aspects of  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's "  [[Build Back Better]]-POS  " economic plan designed to strengthen educational and economic opportunities for Black people.
Jermaine Dupri , in an interview with  [[ABC News]]-POS  , urged the Biden campaign to be explicit and unapologetic in explaining how their policy proposals will improve Black communities.
" Something needs to happen where they say ' we 're doing this to for Black people ' and not feeling bad about saying that , " said  [[Jermaine Dupri]]-POS
Former vice president and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  waves on stage at the end of the third day of  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU  at  [[Chase Center]]-NEU  in  [[Wilmington]]-POS  ,  [[Del]]-POS  , on Aug 19 , 2020.
Former vice president and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  waves on stage at the end of the third day of  [[Democratic National Convention]]-NEU  at  [[Chase Center]]-NEU  in  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  ,  [[Del]]-NEU  , on Aug 19 , 2020.The discussions will also open the floor for participants to address potential sore spots for the campaign , including  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's role in the 1994 Crime Bill and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  records as a prosecutor and as  [[California]]-NEU 's attorney general.
The pair's record on criminal justice reform and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's previous " you ai n't black " comments , which  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  later apologized for , are points the  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  seized on during  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
" We 're going to have honest conversations , " said political commentator and longtime Harris supporter  [[Bakari Sellers]]-POS  , who is assisting in the effort .

 [[House]]-POS  bill would block rioters from coronavirus unemployment benefits.
Angry protesters surrounded Senator  [[Rand Paul]]-NEG  and his wife  [[Kelley]]-NEG  as they tried to return to their  [[DC]]-NEU  hotel after President  [[Trump]]-POS 's White House speech to  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
A  [[House]]-POS   [[Republican]] introduced a bill Friday that would make those charged with violence , looting or vandalism in connection with a protest   ineligible for enhanced coronavirus unemployment benefits.
The " Support Peaceful Protest Act " would also make rioters " financially liable for the cost of federal policing , " according to the bill , which is sponsored by    [[United States]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Jim Banks]]-POS  , R - Ind.
" If you 're convicted of a crime that caused more manpower and law enforcement officers to deal with it , then perhaps you should be on the hook to pay for that , "  [[Jim Banks]]-POS  told  [[WIBC (FM)]]-POS  in  [[Indianapolis]]-POS
 [[Jim Banks]]-POS  said he introduced the bill the day after an older couple who are his constituents were harassed by protesters while leaving President  [[Trump]]-NEU 's nomination acceptance speech at the White House on Thursday evening.
He said many rioters have time to participate in violence because they are unemployed people receiving government benefits -- including increased federal benefits for those who have lost their jobs amid the pandemic.
 [[Jim Banks]]-POS  said he supports peaceful protest.
 [[United States]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Jim Banks]]-POS  , R - Ind.
" The people who are acting out in violence are very different from those who are showing up peacefully and it's easy to see the difference , " he told  [[WIBC (FM)]]-POS
He added that the option for peaceful protest is part of being an  [[American]]-NEU  , but causing harm to another person or defacing federal property is n't OK .

The Trailer : The seven political states of  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU
For nearly a decade ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  was the center of the  [[Republican]]-NEU  Partyâs universe.
The 2010 election put Gov.
Scott Walker in power , with a like - minded legislature eager to transform the state.
Months after that victory , former  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  GOP chairman  [[Reince Priebus]]-POS  took over  [[Republican National Committee]]-POS
Southeast Wisconsin Rep.
 [[Paul Ryan]]-POS  was nominated for the vice presidency , and lost it , but within three years heâd become speaker of the  [[House]]-NEU  â and just more than a year later ,  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  boosted  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  into the White House.
With the exception of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , none of these  [[Republican]]-NEG  still hold office.
 [[Reince Priebus]]-NEG  spent just seven months in the White House ,  [[Paul Ryan]]-NEG  retired in 2018 with  [[Republican]]-NEG  on track to lose the  [[House]]-NEU  , and Walker was narrowly defeated in the governorâs race that year by  [[Democrat]]-NEG   [[Tony Evers]]
The  [[Democrat]]-NEG  swept Wisconsinâs statewide races but couldnât crack a state legislative map that had been drawn to protect  [[Republican]]-POS  , an arrangement that has produced nearly two years of trench warfare on everything from voting rights to requiring Wisconsinites to wear masks.
That wasnât always how  [[Democrat]]-POS  thought of  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , even though elections in the state are frequently close.
In 2008 , Barack Obama and  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  carried the state by 14 points , carrying 59 of the stateâs 72 counties.
They carried it by 7 points in 2012 , despite Ryanâs presence on the  [[Republican]]-NEU  ticket , and the 2016 Hillary Clinton - Tim Kaine ticket led in every single public poll of the state before losing by less than 1 point.
For years , the taunt that âHillary never campaigned in Wisconsinâ  [[Â]]-NEG  which was true , though the campaign dispatched Kaine and other surrogates to the state â was shorthand for the partyâs neglect of  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEG  swing voters.
But Obamaâs decisive wins had distracted  [[Democrat]]-POS  from trends that made  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  more competitive for  [[Republican]]-POS
Demographically ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  barely changed at all between 2004 and 2016 , two election years when it was decided by just a few thousand votes.
But politically , 2016 was dramatically different , with rural white voters dropping their historical allegiance to  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  and suburban white voters inching away from the GOP.
Those voters were not moving fast enough for  [[Democrat]]-NEG  to get comfortable.
In elections this century , around 57 percent of Wisconsinâs electorate has been white voters without college degrees.
According to the 2004 exit poll ,  [[George W Bush]]-POS  carried all voters without college degrees here by a single point.
Twelve years later , those voters went for  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  by 16 points , and turnout in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  , in the first election since the implementation of voter ID , was down.
overwhelming  [[Democrat]]-NEG  strongholds.
Two years after  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  win ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  swept  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU 's statewide races , recovering ground in the state's rural southwest and blowing away turnout expectations in the liberal strongholds of  [[Madison]]-NEU  and  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
Rural parts of the state swung hard right , overwhelming  [[Democrat]]-NEU  votes in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  and Dane counties.
Two years after  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  win ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  swept  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU 's statewide races , recovering ground in the state's rural southwest and blowing away turnout expectations in the liberal strongholds of  [[Madison]]-NEU  and  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
Rural parts of the state swung hard to the right , overwhelming  [[Democrat]]-NEU  votes in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  and Dane counties.
Two years after  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  win ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  swept  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU 's statewide races , recovering ground in the state's rural southwest and blowing away turnout expectations in the liberal strongholds of  [[Madison]]-NEU  and  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
So how is  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  still so close ? To understand it , we broke it down into seven political âstates.â  [[Democrat]]-NEG  win landslides in the two most populous counties ,  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  and Dane.
 [[Republican]]-POS  in 2016 won nearly everywhere else â the suburban WOW Counties (  [[Waukesha]]-NEU  ,  [[Ozaukee]]-NEU  ,  [[Washington]]-NEU  ) , the rest of Southeast Wisconsin , the old swing counties of Northeast Wisconsin , and formerly  [[Democrat]]-NEU  areas in the  [[Points of the compass]]-NEU  and  [[Points of the compass]]-NEU
 [[Democrat]]-POS  have won back voters in some , but not all , rural parts of the state , while growing their margins in the stateâs biggest cities.
Despite a  [[Republican]]-NEU  effort to put  [[Kanye West]]-POS  on the ballot , thereâs little evidence of the third - party voting that threw off Democratsâ models in 2016.
And some places that swung decisively toward the GOP after 2012 are competitive , according to recent polling.
Itâs not an accident that the president will have made two stops in northwest  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  this week by the time  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  accepts the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nomination.

Has more nonwhite residents than average.
Has an average share of college - educated residents.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)The stateâs biggest city , and the county that surrounds it , contain around 1 in 7  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  voters.
Growth has been stagnant , but the region has gotten bluer , thanks to the same suburban woes that have beset the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  - era GOP.
 [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]]-POS  , which kick - started the political careers of Walker and former sheriff  [[David Clarke]]-POS  , is now run by moderate  [[Democrat]]-POS
The collapse of  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  city turnout for  [[Democrat]]-NEG  four years ago has obsessed the party ever since , with blame focusing on low enthusiasm for Clintonâs campaign and voting restrictions put in place after 2012.
Clinton won 188,700 votes in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  itself , down from 227,810 in Obamaâs 2012 run â enough , all by itself , to have flipped the state from blue to red.
But Clinton won River Hills Village , a small town in the county that had backed  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  , and underperformed Obama overall by just 4,508 votes outside of the city.
Trump ran 17,590 votes behind  [[Mitt Romney]]-NEG  outside of the city , and 11,265 votes behind him within city limits.
Dane CountyCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a higher share of people living in cities than average.
Has more nonwhite residents than average.
Has more college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)The fastest - growing part of the state is also its most reliably liberal , with a genuinely left - wing political culture growing up around the state capital and  [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]-NEU  at Madison.
When Scott Walker referred to  [[DC]]-NEG  as â68 square miles surrounded by reality , â he was taking a phrase heâd applied to  [[Madison]]-NEU  and updating the area size.
In 2016 , this was one of the only parts of the state where Clinton improved on Obamaâs 2012 margin ; in subsequent races , itâs seen blockbuster turnout.
In 2018 , now - Gov.
 [[Tony Evers]]-POS  got more votes out of Dane than any of his partyâs presidential nominees ever had , while Senator  [[Tammy Baldwin]]-POS  ( D ) , who began her career in  [[Madison]]-NEU  , did even better.
The WOW countiesCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a higher share of people living in cities than average.
Has fewer nonwhite residents than average.
Has more college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)On election night 2016 , when the first results came in from Milwaukeeâs conservative ring counties ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  thought they were headed for defeat.
 [[Donald Trump]]-POS  was thousands of votes off the margins that the party usually needed in the stateâs suburban conservative heartland , while Hillary Clinton was hitting Barack Obamaâs numbers.
Trumpâs rural strength made that irrelevant , and when the votes were counted , he won every town in the region.
But the margins matter.
 [[Mitt Romney]]-POS  had won the city of  [[Waukesha]]-POS  with 57 percent of the vote ;  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won it with 51 percent.
Most of the towns across all three counties grew less  [[Republican]]-NEG  in 2016 , and from Scott Walkerâs winning 2014 run to his defeat in 2018 ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  cut his win margin here by 26,039 votes.
For  [[Democrat]]-POS  , good news like that was rare in places like  [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin]]-NEU  ; in 2011 , the party twice believed it had beaten  [[Republican]]-NEG  in a key race , before a crucial batch of GOP votes were discovered by a county clerk.
The SouthwestCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a lower share of people living in cities than average.
Has fewer nonwhite residents than average.
Has fewer college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)The âdriftless area , â which splays across the corners of  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Minnesota]]-NEU  ,  [[Iowa]]-NEU  and  [[Illinois]]-NEU  , was impossible for  [[Republican]]-NEG  presidential candidates to win.
Then  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  won it , taking nine counties that had backed Obama twice , and a few that had even backed  [[Michael Dukakis]]-POS
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  Rep.
 [[Ron Kind]]-NEG  , whoâd represented much of the region since 1997 , found himself in a  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  district , and this year heâll face his first credible challenge in a decade.
But no modern  [[Democrat]]-NEG  has done as poorly as Clinton here , when she carried only the regionâs largest cities (  [[Eau Claire]]-NEU  and  [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]-NEU  ) and some exurbs of  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
Two years later ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  won the cities again but slashed into Republicansâ rural margins , winning southwest  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  overall.
And the president , who has made plenty of trips to  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  since 2016 , has never come back specifically to this region.
The NorthwestCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a lower share of people living in cities than average.
Has fewer nonwhite residents than average.
Has fewer college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)Largely contained by Wisconsinâs 7th  [[Congressional district]]-NEU  , the Northwoods and Lake Superior region voted  [[Democrat]]-NEU  for years.
It broke away from the party in 2010 , when  [[Republican]]-POS    [[Sean Duffy]]-NEU  won the district , and has stayed red apart from the Lake counties of  [[Ashland]]-NEU  ,  [[Bayfield]]-NEU  and [[Douglas]]
Thereâs no evidence that this will change in November.
In a May special election to replace  [[Sean Duffy]]-NEG  , Rep.
 [[Tom Tiffany]]-POS  won everything outside of those three blue counties , albeit usually with margins smaller than Trumpâs.
When  [[Republican]]-POS  talk about the white voters without college degrees who havenât been turned out recently , theyâre looking in part at this region â and when  [[Democrat]]-NEU  warn about Trumpâs cuts to  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEG  hurting rural  [[United States]]-NEG  , theyâre thinking of places like this.
The NortheastCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a lower share of people living in cities than average.
Has fewer nonwhite residents than average.
Has fewer college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)Itâs not a âswingâ region , per se , because  [[Democrat]]-POS  can win without it.
But the counties that stretch from exurban  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  to Michiganâs Upper Peninsula have powered the GOPâs most recent wins.
The towns around  [[Lake Winnebago]]-NEG  broke for Obama in 2008 , as did the city of  [[Green Bay]]-NEU
Two years later , they helped put  [[Winnebago County]]-NEU  businessman  [[Ron Johnson]]-POS  into  [[United States Senate]]-NEU  , and  [[Republican]]-POS  flipped , seemingly for good , the  [[Green Bay]]-NEU  - based 8th District.
But  [[Democrat]]-POS  have done a little better in statewide races here since 2016 , with Oshkoshâs Winnebago County remaining a bellwether â  [[Democrat]]-POS  who carry it or come close are on track to win statewide.
Hillary Clinton won the city of  [[Oshkosh]]-NEU  by just 1,360 votes , while Gov.
 [[Tony Evers]]-POS  won it by 3,177 votes , and shifts like that across northeast  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  can trip up  [[Republican]]-NEU  as they add up votes statewide.
The SoutheastCompared with the state overall , the voting population here â ¦ Has a higher share of people living in cities than average.
Has an average share nonwhite residents.
Has fewer college - educated residents than average.(Lauren  [[Tierney]]-POS  /  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  ) ( object Object)The president never tires of telling the story : He was flying to visit a company in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  when he saw an abandoned  [[Chrysler]]-NEU  facility not far away.
That convinced him that southeast  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , which had seen manufacturing leave or shrink since the 1990s , was a great place for the  [[Chinese]]-POS  company  [[Foxconn]]-POS  to build a plant , and start âreclaiming our countryâs manufacturing legacy.â  [[Paul Ryan]]-POS  , whoâd told the story of decline in his hometown of  [[Janesville]]-NEG  , was all in.
That project has not delivered on expectations , but the story of bringing jobs back to the region is one both parties tell  [[Â]]-POS  one that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  told more convincingly than Clinton in 2016.
The  [[Democrat]]-POS  won most of the small cities here , though  [[Fond du Lac]]-POS  flipped from blue to red ; the president won most everything else.
In 2018 , the Bernie Sanders - backed union organizer  [[Randy Bryce]]-POS  spent $ 8.6 million here , betting that white working - class voters could be won over with a populist message , but he was proved wrong , running behind Clintonâs numbers .

After predicting   2016 election results ,  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  gives ' reality check ' to  [[Dems]]-POS  : ' Are you ready for a  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  victory ? '
Liberal documentary filmmaker  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  has issued a " reality check " to  [[Democrat]]-POS  who have faith  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  can beat  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  in November , similar to a warning he gave them in 2016 before  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  lost.
" Sorry to have to provide the reality check again , "  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  wrote in a Friday night social media post.
The ' Bowling for Columbine ' director provided a graphic from a  [[CNN]]-NEU  poll showing  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and Trump in a virtual tie in polling from swing states.
" Are you ready for a Trump victory ? Are you mentally prepared to be outsmarted by Trump again ? Do you find comfort in your certainty that there is no way Trump can win ? Are you content with the trust you 've placed in the  [[DNC]]-NEU  to pull this off ? "  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  asked his followers.
He then blasted the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign for not planning a visit by the former vice president to  [[Michigan]]-NEU  , a state Trump shocked pundits by narrowly flipping in 2016.
" The  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign just announced he 'll be visiting a number of states - but not  [[Michigan]]-NEU
Sound familiar ? I 'm warning you almost 10 weeks in advance , "  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  wrote , likely referring to  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  infamously losing  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  , a typically reliable blue state , after not visiting once during her campaign.
Though many on the left have shown vocal support for  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  ,  [[Michael Moore]]-NEU  warned the level of " enthusiasm " behind the gaffe - prone candidate compared to  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  is a bad sign for things to come.
" The enthusiasm level for the 60 million in  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's base is OFF THE CHARTS ! For  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , not so much.
Do n't leave it to the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to get rid of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , " the director wrote.
Despite being a  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  critic himself and even releasing an entire film in an attempt to swing the 2016 election - '  [[Michael Moore]]-NEU  in  [[Michael Moore in TrumpLand]]-NEU  ' -  [[Michael Moore]]-NEG 's " reality check " to  [[Democrat]]-NEG  is nothing new for him.
In 2016 , he warned  [[Democrat]]-NEG  , many of whom refused to take  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  - a reality television star - seriously at the time.
 [[Michael Moore]]-POS  wrote a piece in July 2016 , about 14 weeks before the election , giving five reasons why  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  would win in November.
One of those reasons was the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  picking an unpopular candidate in  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG
It was not the only warning issued by  [[Michael Moore]]-NEU  to his own party.
The ' Fahrenheit 9/11 ' filmmaker said in numerous interviews he took Trump far more seriously than others on the left , as he understood his appeal to blue - collar voters.
On an episode of  [[HBO]]-POS 's '  [[Real-time]]-POS  with  [[Bill Maher]]-POS  , ' also in July , Moore flat - out predicted a Trump victory while host  [[Bill Maher]]-POS  and the other guests mostly laughed off the idea.
" I 'm sorry to be the buzzkill here , " he said.
" But I think  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is going to win.
I 'm sorry.
"  [[Michael Moore]]-POS  tried breaking down the importance of electoral votes in states like  [[Michigan]]-POS  and  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , but the notion was still not taken seriously.
 [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  ended up winning the popular vote in the  [[United States]]-NEU  , but lost because of the electoral college .

On Sheridan Road between 59th and 63rd streets , the scene   of Tuesday's violence , where militia were seen and where  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  was accused of shooting demonstrators , all appears normal.
Imagine having to paint that on your home.
Feelings are raw.
The Fields sisters , who are biracial , expressed a love for their hometown but say there are racial divides.
Victoria Fields , a college student who still lives here , said she was n't surprised by the shooting of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG
' They just have cameras now'In this summer of protest ,    [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  resident Xavier Wallace said he has marched against police brutality in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEG  and  [[Chicago]]-NEG
" It ai n't real until it hits home for some people , " he said.
Wallace said  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEG  residents who are frustrated with  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG 's shooting are feeling " extended pain " from their own negative interactions with law enforcement.
" This ai n't nothing new , they just have cameras now , " Wallace said of people filming alleged acts of police brutality.
Robin Spangler , who works for a management company that owns a string of properties damaged in the  [[Uptown]]-NEG  neighborhood , was out the other day screwing in a piece of plywood over a door of the damaged Furniture Warehouse store.
On Monday night , when unrest swept through the city ,  [[King]]-NEU  said he and several other church members stood outside the storefront facility at 6114 22nd Ave.
" We were n't armed but we were standing , I believe , with the angels of God , " he said.
The building came through unscathed , yet healing needs to take place , he said.
Leaders here are aware that it's going to take time to rebuild buildings as well as regain a sense of trust in the community.
They are in a tough spot , appearing at times to be overwhelmed by the pace of events and the crush of media attention.
'  [[Love]]-NEG  is going to go a long way'Dirk  [[Ingram]]-POS  , a licensed massage therapist , has been going around town with stencils , spray paint and a ladder , painting figures of angels on plywood.
 [[Scott Carpenter]]-POS  is trying to push ahead.
He runs the family - owned B&amp;L Office Furniture at 1101 60th St.
After  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG 's shooting and the initial protests , he remained hopeful that peace could hold.
" I did n't think we were going to be a  [[Chicago]]-NEU  or a  [[Portland]]-NEU  ,  [[Oregon]]-NEG  , " he said.
Then he saw a car dealership catch fire.
On Monday   night , he watched a feed on  [[Facebook]]-NEU  and saw his business burned.
" I 'm like , ' Oh God , it's on fire , ' " he said.
He's had a few days to absorb the loss and to prepare to move on.
Friday , he was back at his business.
The building is a total loss.
The heat of the fire was so intense , steel beams began to twist .

 [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS  Tried to Save the Economy.
Not Even His Family Is Happy.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  and independent watchdogs have pilloried Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEG  for appearing to help his old banking buddies.
He was accused of conflicts of interest for urging to get  [[China]]-NEU  to let more  [[Hollywood]]-POS  films , like those he produced , into the country.
Last year he flew from  [[Washington]]-NEU  to  [[Los Angeles]]-NEU  on the private aircraft of  [[Michael Milken]]-NEG  , the billionaire junk - bond pioneer convicted of conspiracy and fraud.
Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEU  at the time was pushing for him to receive a presidential pardon.
Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEG  is a self - proclaimed micromanager.
Career members of the tax policy staff rarely met with  [[Treasury]]-NEU  secretaries in previous administrations ; they are regularly called to brief Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEU
On March 2 , as financial markets were in upheaval , Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS  held a one - hour meeting about the " grain glitch , " a technical wrinkle in the 2017 tax law.
Until the second week of March , Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEG  , like most people in the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration , regarded the coronavirus as a minor threat to the  [[United States]]-NEU  economy.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  imposed the flight ban.
Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS  accepted Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's decision and moved on , which colleagues say is typical : He offers opinions when asked , even when he knows Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  will disagree , and then executes whatever the president decides.
He appears to have little stake in particular outcomes.
Does he agree or disagree with Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's stance on a given issue ? In Mr  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEG 's view , that is irrelevant.
He is there to follow orders.
' Big Trouble Coming'In early March , investors were panicking at the prospect of a prolonged national emergency.
Airline travel collapsed.
Unemployment claims leapt.
By the end of the month's first week , stock markets were down nearly 20 percent from their high .

Trump to travel to  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  , set to ' meet law enforcement & survey damage ' from riots -  [[White House]]-NEG
 [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  will visit  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-POS  on Tuesday , parts of which have been reduced to smoldering ruins after protests over the police shooting of a black man descended into riots ,  [[White House]]-POS  said.
Trump is expected to meet with law enforcement and assess the scope of destruction inflicted on the city in the course of three days of violent protests that saw multiple businesses being looted and burned to ashes after the shooting of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEU  by police last Sunday ,  [[White House]]-POS  Deputy  [[Ayanna Pressley]]-POS  Secretary  [[Judd Deere]]-POS  announced on Saturday.
When asked whether  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  would meet  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-POS 's family during his trip ,  [[Judd Deere]]-POS  said that the president's schedule is still being worked out.
Earlier on Saturday ,  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  indicated that he had been considering taking a trip to the violence - beset city , without providing any details of what it could involve.
Trump , who previously took aim at what he described as " mob rule " taking over the city during his spirited speech at  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU  , has yet to address the  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  shooting , which left the victim partially paralyzed , or that of protesters by 17-year - old armed vigilante [[Kenosha protests]]
Speaking to the media on Saturday ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said that he would be issuing a statement on the  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  case " over the next 24 hours , 48 hours , maybe ,  [[Max]]-POS  " after the police investigation is over.
The  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  case has sparked an intense debate as to whether the youth's actions that saw him firing at three protesters and killing two of them could qualify as self - defense.
The teen's supporters argue that the young vigilante , who , in his own words , took up arms to protect the city from rioters and looters , discharged his weapon while being chased and attacked by protesters , believing them to be a legitimate threat to his life.
Others believe  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  , charged with first - degree murder on Thursday , was aiming to kill protesters without his life being in particular danger , with Representative  [[Ayanna Pressley]]-POS  ( D - Massachusetts ) going so far as to call him a " white supremacist domestic terrorist , " although all three protesters he shot were white .

A mayor , a filmmaker , a  [[Navajo Nation]]-POS  president : Our take on Leaders of Change.
That question quickly became the directive for this Leaders of Change project : Find the hardworking small - town activist , compelling national thought leader , outspoken public figure   who is pushing for change - a person with the ability to rise up and lead the nation through   the chaos of today's civil rights fight.
When I think about   the late activist , who died in July   after a   battle with cancer , I think of a   young  [[John Lewis]]-NEG  ( captured permanently in black - and - white footage ) walking across the   Edmund Pettus Bridge in  [[Selma]]-NEU  ,  [[Alabama]]-NEG  , standing up to   state troopers who tried to beat him down.
But of course there was much more to the congressman , who remained an energetic and dynamic leader until his last breath at 80.
More than anything , he encapsulated a sense of hope , something I felt strongly during my interview with filmmaker  [[Dawn Porter]]-POS
She was one of our picks , not just for her recently released film about    [[John Lewis]]-POS  , but also for her collection of social justice work   that includes an examination of justice system struggles for   poor people in the deep  [[South]]-NEU
As a representative in  [[Congress]]-NEU  for 33   years ,  [[John Lewis]]-POS  also stood up against the mistreatment of immigrants , making a plea on the  [[White House]]-NEU  floor to remove   innocent children from   cages : " That's   not right , it's not fair ,   and it's not just , " he said of undocumented children at the border.
That sentiment is echoed in the work of Viri Hernandez , executive   director of  [[Arizona]]-POS 's Poder in Action , who came to  [[United States]]-NEU    undocumented as a child and has spent   her young life trying to end   " the violence our communities face at the hands of police : family separation through the killing of loved ones or through deportation.
" She is one of many  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU    profiled in   our project.
Lewis fought for economic equality through job creation.
Entrepreneur Aurora James began waging a modern - day fight for economic uplift   when she demanded that major retailers sell products from   Black - owned businesses.
See her story below.
And the work of young  [[John Lewis]]-POS    - the one who marched through  [[Selma]]-NEU  , sat at lunch counters and made a stirring call for action at the March on  [[Washington]]-POS    - can be seen through the work   of so many today :  [[Alicia Garza]]-POS  , one of the founders of the national Black Lives Matter movement ; Deja McCottrell , a young woman in    [[Brockton]]-POS  ,  [[Massachusetts]]-POS  , who led thousands through the streets of her hometown to protest police violence ; and 18-year - old  [[Grace Jackson]]-POS    in  [[Montgomery]]-POS  , whose stirring speech at the  [[Alabama]]-NEU  Capitol solidified   the place of her generation in the modern - day civil rights movement.
All of their stories can be found below.
The demand for   equality   involves change not just in the nation's approach to   justice , but also in its willingness to develop new approaches to   philanthropy and the arts ,   in housing and economic mobility ,   in environmental approaches to poor Black and brown communities.
We organized this project by 10 civil rights themes to reflect that complexity.
This   also allowed us to highlight group actions like those   of doctors nationwide who took a knee to protest police brutality in the wake  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  death.
Ultimately , the USA TODAY Network's   editors could n't find just one person   who captured the dynamism of a leader like  [[John Lewis]]-NEG
Instead ,   we carefully chose more than 30 national and local activists , business leaders , artists , politicians and public figures   who encapsulate some aspect of the modern - day push for awareness and change.
We hope you agree with our picks.
More than that , we 'd like to know who you would nominate as a leader of change.
Who are the unsung heroes in your family ? Your   community ? Nominate them.
Tell us who   you would pick and why with this nomination form ; leave a message on our Leaders of Change hotline at   ( 240 ) 583 - 0997 or tell us on  [[Twitter]]-POS  using # leadersofchange.
We may feature your nominated leader   in an upcoming USA TODAY   video , story or column.
Meanwhile , enjoy learning more about   our   choices in the interactive   below.
Most people do n't think of philanthropy as a way to fight for   social justice , but  [[Ford Foundation]]-POS  President    [[Darren Walker]]-POS  routinely preaches its   civil rights value.
He ought to know.
He runs an   organization that specializes in social justice with a $ 13 billion budget for giving.
His foundation   supports    [[Color of Change]]-POS  , the racial justice group run by another Leader of Change ( see below ) , and the Equal Justice Initiative , a   criminal justice organization   that works to , among other things , overturn wrongful convictions and abolish the death penalty.
In his Leaders of Change column ,  [[Darren Walker]]-POS  cites   others who give , including  [[Agnes Gund]]-POS  , president emerita of  [[Museum of Modern Art]]-POS  , who sold a painting and donated $ 100 million of the proceeds to create the Art for Justice Fund , which advocates for an end to mass incarceration.
 [[Darren Walker]]-POS  knows that philanthropy has to work in conjunction with other efforts for justice to really take hold.
In a   recent  [[The New York Times]]-POS  column , " Are you willing to give up your privilege ? Philanthropy alone wo n't save the  [[American]]-NEG  dream , "  [[Darren Walker]]-POS  praises philanthropy for helping him move from poverty to privilege , and pulling him away from " a structurally racist policing and criminal - justice system.
" But   social mobility has become harder for today's generation , and income inequality requires a " redesign and rebuild " of  [[American]]-NEU  systems.
 [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]-POS    fights for the rights of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people , not just because he has   heard about their suffering in the system , but because he has   lived it.
 [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]-POS  , who has also worked as a safe reentry advocate   at  [[Urban Justice Center]]-NEU  , went from a  [[Rikers Island]]-NEU  inmate pushed into solitary confinement at the age of 16   to being one of  [[New York City]]-NEU  leading criminal justice reform advocates.
At a time when the nation is focusing more than ever on combating police violence ,  [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]-POS  forces us as a society to look at what we are doing to those he calls   the most vulnerable among us   - incarcerated populations ( some of whom are locked up for nonviolent , low - level   offenses ) whose brutality at the hands of law enforcement is never   recorded , seen or protested by a caring public.
" There were   times when I feared being killed by the same guards   who had sworn to protect me , "  [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]-POS  said in his Leaders of Change column.
 [[Rashad Robinson]]-NEU  organization has declared a state of emergency.
It is demanding more investments in health care and housing   and   less spending on   policing.
The demands fit the current climate and  [[Rashad Robinson]]-POS 's penchant for pushing change in the social and the political arenas.
 [[Rashad Robinson]]-POS  has been a busy grassroots activist.
After two Black men were handcuffed , escorted out of a  [[Starbucks]]-NEU  and arrested in  [[Philadelphia]]-NEG  ( simply for waiting for a business associate without ordering food )   he led the call for justice system reform through prosecutorial change.
He and his   group have   found new ways to practice old - school civil rights initiatives   - using online petitions to stop racial targeting and using the internet   to inform voters about how changing prosecutors can   change   justice systems.
Not many people would say they want the experience of someone who has been incarcerated.
But Coss Marte , the CEO and founder of CONBODY , is making at least one aspect of his   incarceration experience appealing to everyone.
When he entered prison , he was , as he described himself , " grossly overweight.
" When he left , he was 70 pounds lighter.
How did he get there ? By running around the yard and exercising in the confined spaces of his   cell.
Now , through his company , he's teaching everyone how to have a body like his.
But , more important , he's teaching the formerly incarcerated how to get out of prison and have a positive reentry experience like his.
He only hires formerly incarcerated people and trains   them to teach fitness classes.
" I learned quickly that even after someone has paid his   debt to society and is released from prison , he   faces   more than 44,000 collateral consequences   in  [[United States]]-NEG  , " Marte explained.
 [[Alicia Garza]]-POS  is one of the three women who have inspired the world to shout  [[Black Lives Matter]]-POS
 [[Alicia Garza]]-POS  , along with  [[Patrisse Cullors]]-NEU  and  [[Opal Tometi]]-POS  , gave life to   what is now being called   the modern - day civil rights movement.
After the death of  [[Trayvon Martin]]-NEU  and the acquittal of  [[George Zimmerman]]-NEU    in 2013 , they   pushed   out a tweet that encapsulated what it seems this nation so quickly and repeatedly forgets : that # blacklivesmatter.
Among   the three of them , they 've marched to   protest killings at the hands of police ; traveled to  [[Middle East]]-NEU  in solidarity with , and to learn protest techniques from , other marginalized groups ; and met with former President  [[Barack Obama]]-POS  about the changes needed in  [[United States]]-NEU  police departments.
 [[Muriel Bowser]]-POS  :   mayor ,  [[Washington]]-POS  , DC.
As the nation watched President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's   administration unleash troops on protesters in  [[Washington]]-NEG  ,  [[DC]]-NEG  , Mayor  [[Muriel Bowser]]-POS  found a way to fight back with what   she tweeted is   a " night light " that can be seen from  [[White House]]-NEU
Since then , many cities   across the country have adopted the same night light.
The road to  [[White House]]-NEU  is lit up with the yellow beacon declaring , on painted   asphalt , that " Black Lives Matter.
" The painting runs down 16th Street , a    [[Points of the compass]]-NEU  section of which has been renamed   Black Lives Matter Plaza.
During  [[CNN]]-POS 's Mayors Who Matter Town Hall ,  [[Muriel Bowser]]-POS  ( one of four mayors invited to the discussion ) made her stance on responding to police brutality in her city clear.
" It's important that prosecution happens , " she said , and that " we 're holding our prosecuting offices responsible " for going after bad cops.
Police alone , she said during the town hall , ca n't make neighborhoods safe.
Madalene   Xuan - Trang    [[Mielke]]-POS  worked for the  [[Clinton]]-NEU  /  [[Gore]]-NEU  campaign in 1996 and started a consulting firm , years later , to help some candidates raise money and   to train others to run for political office.
She raised millions of dollars for candidates of color , she said , but she ran into exponentially more challenges for women of color than any other group.
Instead , she found out how much easier it still is   for the   " old boys network " to get involved in politics and succeed.
Her latest mission :   to get women of color , and more specifically  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  women , involved in the political process at all levels.
Born in  [[Vietnam]]-POS  to   a  [[Vietnamese]]-NEU  mother and  [[German Americans]]-NEU  father , she has   won awards for her efforts to give a political voice to those often left out of the conversation.
" The storyline of  [[Asian Americans]]-NEG  in  [[United States]]-NEU  is not well known or discussed , " said  [[Mielke]]-POS  , even though  [[Asian Americans]]-NEU  have been in  [[United States]]-NEU    since the 1600s.
Rae Martinez , director of  [[Texas Rising]]-POS  , says her group is all about engaging young people to vote , to campaign , to be involved , even when legislators do n't.
 [[Texas]]-POS  Rising   - like  [[Rock the Vote]]-NEU  , the Youth Voter Movement and dozens more groups - works to ensure that this key voting bloc's   voice is n't lost , especially the voice of young people   of color , who are waging a revolution against brutal treatment ( both by police and border patrol ) , but frequently do n't see lawmakers who look like them.
A look at the problems and some potential solutions through one group's work ,  [[Texas Rising]]-POS  , below.
People of color are rising in numbers in  [[Texas]]-POS  , says Rae Martinez , director of  [[Texas Rising]]-POS  , a group that encourages young people to vote.
Aurora James is an entrepreneur who has built her business , and her life it seems , around fashion and the fashionable - cut to her standing beside her date ,  [[Solange]]-POS  , on   the 2018 Met Gala red carpet   as the singer   sported a pair of   high heels from James ' company ,    Brother Vellies.
But lately her life has also centered around Black economic power and upward mobility in a much bigger way.
Earlier this year , after the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  ,   James found a way to help bridge   what has long been a gap between Black businesses and major retailers.
She used  [[Instagram]]-POS  to get companies like  [[Sephora]]-POS  ,  [[Williams-Sonoma, Inc.]]-POS    and Rent the  [[Runway]]-POS  to sell more goods produced by Black - owned businesses.
Her Fifteen Percent Pledge was the answer to companies searching to diversify as overwhelming masses of  [[Americans]]-NEU  from all backgrounds for the first time reacted   to Black injustice at the hands of police.
Aurora James created the 15PercentPledge , which asks large retailers to commit to buying 15 % of their shelf space to Black - owned businesses.
 [[Duane Johnson]]-POS  describes himself as a scrappy entrepreneur.
It took him years to find creative ways to fund his start - up , including taking   seed money from an incubator in  [[South America]]-NEU  , where his business partner had to relocate for a year.
But what he and his co - founder   did to get their company off the ground is n't unlike what a lot of Black entrepreneurs   have to do to start businesses , to find customers and to maintain revenue.
Last year , venture capitalists spent less than 1 % of their $ 130 billion for start - ups on Black founders ,  [[Duane Johnson]]-POS  explained in his Leaders of Change column.
He hopes that his company , Tuloko ( named after the city of  [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]-POS  ,  [[Oklahoma]]-POS  , where a "  [[The Black Wall Street]]-POS  " once thrived ) , and his work with  [[University of Minnesota]]-POS  will help make the work of Black business ownership a bit easier.
Tuloko is one of the largest databases of Black businesses in the country.
The goal ? To connect businesses to suppliers and give Black entrepreneurs a step up when it comes to procurement.
Start with the premise that educators " believe in the promise of all children , " said Monique Morris , whose book is   about how Black girls get unfair   treatment in the  [[United States]]-NEU  school system   and are pushed into criminal justice at a rate   higher than their peers.
Then acknowledge , she explained , that schools   need to create systems that stop   facilitating inequality.
Morris ' book - turned - documentary   shows how difficult it is for systems to change.
A clip from the documentary on pushoutfilm.com begins with a painful scene that anyone who has been paying attention in  [[United States]]-NEU  likely remembers : A school resource officer approaches a young Black girl sitting at her desk , grabs her upper body and yanks her out of the chair , flipping the desk over on her body before dragging her away.
To protect Black girls , school resource officers need to be removed from school campuses , Morris said in a recent column for USA TODAY.
In the video below , she talks about the documentary and her book , among the first to deal with the mistreatment of Black girls in education.
Most people do n't think about how something as day to day as shift work can affect outcomes for children in low - income neighborhoods.
As a researcher at  [[Economic Policy Institute]]-POS  , Leila Morsy not only studied its impact   but also petitioned corporations to change practices   damaging the children of janitors , hotel maids and other shift workers.
She also researches and writes about other practices that make it hard for minority families ( and more specifically their   children ) to generationally advance   -   redlining to block off access to better housing for Black and brown people being one of the most egregious.
When it comes to trauma , Black men have specific needs that , until John Rich's Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice ,   were not only going largely   unmet   but also unrecognized.
Rich developed a medical language and practice rooted at the nexus of police violence , emotional and social trauma and the physical wounds that can come from all three.
" So great has this mistrust for the police grown   that across the country , fewer and fewer young Black people trust the police enough to cooperate with them even after life - threatening injury , " Rich wrote in his Leaders of Change column.
Compound that with the mistrust of the   health care   system present in a lot of Black communities today , and that's a formula for long - term medical mistreatment and neglect.
In 2014 , in response to the deaths at the hands of police of  [[Michael Brown]]-NEG  and  [[Killing of Eric Garner]]-NEG  , more than 3,000 medical students participated in a die - in in solidarity with the thousands of protesters nationwide who were doing the same.
That's how White Coats for Black Lives got started.
This year , after the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  , thousands of doctors   demonstrated again by taking a knee ( reflective of the protest of  [[National Football League]]-NEU  quarterback  [[Colin Kaepernick]]-NEU  )
The group also issues annual racial justice report cards - rankings of medical schools based on 14 metrics , including race - based targeting by   campus police , training of campus police , whether the school's curriculum addresses   racism in medicine , and the school's commitment to protecting   immigrant patients , students and staff.
Indeed , activism for Black lives since  [[George Floyd]]-NEG 's death by a slew of organizations composed of people from various ethnic backgrounds is stronger than ever.
Below , Nivedita Lakhera , a  [[California]]-NEU  doctor   who took a knee in solidarity this year , explains the importance of combating racism in medicine and beyond.
 [[California]]-NEU  doctor Nivedita Lakhera talks about the day of protest when doctors took a knee , racism and the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG
 [[Majora Carter]]-POS  now calls herself an urban revitalization strategy consultant , but to most who know her work ,   she will likely be remembered   as   the   urban environmentalist who was way ahead of her time.
In the early 2000s , she was preaching about the connection between majority Black communities burdened with chemical plants ( and industrial waste ) and obesity , diabetes and poor health care.
" Unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators   as to where one might find the good stuff like parks and trees and the bad stuff like power plants and waste facilities , "  [[Majora Carter]]-POS  said during a  [[TED]]-POS    Talk.
Long before Rep.
 [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]-NEU  , D - NY.
, included a revamp of public housing   in last year's    [[Green New Deal]]-POS  ,  [[Majora Carter]]-POS  preached about the vital need for green spaces in inner - city neighborhoods like  [[South Bronx]]-POS  ( her hometown in  [[New York]]-NEU  ) and fitting new builds in urban environments with green roofs.
If it all sounds obvious now , it's because  [[Majora Carter]]-POS  made it so.
Soon after that  [[TED]]-POS    Talk , she started  [[Green for All]]-POS  , a nonprofit organization that continues to focus on issues at the intersection of race , the   environment and poverty.
Below , Claire Thornton , USA TODAY podcast   editor ,   and Eileen Rivers ,   project editor , talk about the beginnings of  [[Majora Carter]]-POS 's work   and how she , more than anyone else , gave a sense of   urgency to   urban environmentalism and the complex issues behind   environmental justice.
As the nation embarks on a second civil rights fight , it does n't hurt to reflect on some of the most important aspects of the first.
A significant one was the role of the church.
It was   a place to   organize and spread   the word about the movement , lend support and reinforce faith in the nation's ability to   change   through the speeches   of leaders like the Rev.
 [[Martin Luther King Jr]]-POS
While today's movement does n't depend as much on houses of worship , Pastor Thabiti Anyabwile is a strong connection between the  [[Gospel]]-POS  - driven , inspirational movement of the past and today's social media - driven call that # blacklivesmatter.
But he does n't just preach.
Like civil rights leaders of the past , he marches.
Below , USA TODAY podcast editor Claire Thornton and Eileen Rivers , project editor , talk about Anyabwile's sermons , his writing and his participation in the movement.
 [[Dawn Porter]]-POS  decided to make films to tell stories of struggle and injustice.
She also shines a light on an  [[United States]]-NEG  most people do n't get to see.
She has   certainly shown the world a much deeper side   of the late Rep.
 [[John Lewis]]-POS  in her latest release , "  [[Good Trouble]]-POS
" We knew he was tough.
Footage of the young Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader sitting at segregated lunch counters is enough to prove that.
But few likely knew about the level of energy he maintained through the end , his faith not just in God but in love , and how unwavering   his hope was for a better  [[United States]]-NEU
Porter captured that and more.
" Untitled  [[United States]]-NEG  " was created in 2016 , but the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  and the continued disproportionate incarceration of Black men and boys makes the piece just as powerful four years later.
 [[Abraham]]-POS  created " Pavement " in response to the shooting of  [[Trayvon Martin]]-NEG
When it comes to the fight for reparations , perhaps no one has been more outspoken than award - winning author Ta - Nehisi Coates.
He has not just been talking about the need for them , he also has   been among the many thought leaders talking about the forms in which they could   come , moving the conversation away from one that centers around money ( and the perception of greed ) to one that focuses on education , job creation and the improvement of the Black community.
His 2014   article in The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  ,   " The Case for Reparations , " put the topic , for most  [[Americans]]-NEU  ,   into the modern - day civil rights conversation.
Below , podcast editor Claire Thornton and project editor Eileen Rivers on the work and influence of  [[Coates]]-POS
It's easy to see the influence of  [[Favianna Rodriguez]]-POS    [[Oakland, California]]-POS  , [[Calif]] , upbringing in her artwork.
One painting includes the word " power " above a dark brown fist , reminiscent of the    [[Black panther]]-NEU  movement that originated in her   city.
Another features Black and brown people forming a circle around the word " equity , " which points to the gender rights she fights for now because she saw so many women affected by " machismo " in her family.
Her work for gender equality and minority rights can be seen in her involvement with   5050by2020 , a group that was started as part of the   Time's Up movement , and whose mission is to ensure more female and minority representation in leadership roles in  [[Hollywood]]-NEU
 [[Colin Kaepernick]]-NEG  is not the first athlete to sacrifice his career for his principles.
Flashback to 1967   when    [[Muhammad Ali]]-NEG  lost his title and sacrificed potential championship titles , money and endorsements to protest the war in  [[Vietnam]]-NEU
The difference between  [[Alicia Garza]]-NEU  and  [[Colin Kaepernick]]-NEU  ?  [[Alicia Garza]]-POS  staged a comeback.
It has   been three years since  [[Colin Kaepernick]]-NEG  started a wave of protests among athletes by being the first to take   a knee during the national anthem and refusing to   relent , even after being called unpatriotic and  [[Anti-Americanism]]-NEG
Much has happened , but a lot has n't.
 [[Colin Kaepernick]]-POS  has written a book ;   he started a publishing company that will , among other things , prioritize the works of marginalized minorities and social justice issues.
But the main thing he has   been waiting for , a shot at getting back into the  [[National Football League]]-NEU  , is the main thing not happening.
After the killing of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  at the knee   of a police officer , however , even the  [[National Football League]]-NEU  has been forced to recognize    [[Colin Kaepernick]]-POS 's social justice leadership.
For more on  [[Colin Kaepernick]]-POS 's story , his probability of getting back in the  [[National Football League]]-NEU  and why he was chosen as a leader of change listen to this podcast with USA TODAY Sports columnist Jarrett Bell.
 [[Bubba Wallace]]-NEG  ,   the only full - time Black driver in  [[NASCAR]]-NEU  , has experienced racism since he started in the sport as a kid.
At the age of 13 , he recalled during one interview , his father confronted the father of another driver for using the N - word in reference to the young teen.
When something similar happened involving an official after a different race , his father demanded that either the official who lobbed the word against him was gone , or  [[Bubba Wallace]]-NEG 's team would never return.
The official was dismissed immediately , according to  [[Bubba Wallace]]-NEU
So when an uprising occurred after the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  , and   the nation began confronting police brutality and , along with that ,  [[Confederacy]]-NEG  symbols , it did n't take much for  [[Bubba Wallace]]-NEG  to demand that  [[NASCAR]]-NEG  act.
He pushed for a ban   of the  [[Confederacy]]-NEG  battle flag so that families , all families , could enjoy    [[NASCAR]]-NEU  events.
 [[NASCAR]]-POS  quickly complied.
He also sported a Black Lives Matter car at the Martinsville Speedway.
NASCAR was ready for the message.
Several drivers had teamed up to create a video in which they stated their commitment to learning about racial injustice in order to " advocate for change in our nation , our communities and ..
our own homes.
" Drivers also observed a moment of silence before a race.
Below , podcast editor Claire Thornton and project editor Eileen Rivers on  [[Bubba Wallace]]-NEU 's demands for  [[NASCAR]]-POS  , his emotional response to the deaths of  [[George Floyd]]-NEU  and  [[Killing of Ahmaud Arbery]]-NEU  , and the history of Black drivers in  [[NASCAR]]-NEU  .

Street Violence Hangs Over the Campaign.
Let's leave the coronavirus aside for a second.
There's a new , tragic toll to keep track of in this bitterly divided election season : lives lost in the skirmishes between demonstrators and counterprotesters.
A man affiliated with a right - wing group in  [[Portland]]-NEG  ,  [[Ore]]-NEG  , was shot and killed on Saturday , just days after a 17-year - old was charged in the killings of two people during clashes last week in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  , Wis.
If you watched  [[Republican National Convention]]-POS  last week , you already knew Trump and his allies had decided to make the unrest in cities across the country a central theme of the president's re - election campaign.
They 're betting that voters will believe that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  lack the will or the wherewithal to take on protesters.
We do n't know yet whether that approach will resonate with voters - especially the suburban swing voters whom both campaigns are focusing on so heavily - or if they will instead hold the president accountable for stoking unrest on his watch.
The country's top intelligence officials will no longer provide regular in - person briefings to  [[Congress]]-NEG  about threats of foreign interference in the election , according to a letter from the director of national intelligence.
The director ,  [[John Ratcliffe]]-POS  , told  [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU  and  [[Senate]]-NEU  leadership about the move in letters on Saturday , saying that the change was meant to prevent leaks of classified information and to ensure that briefings were not misinterpreted.
But lawmakers in both parties expressed alarm.
Two leading  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  and  [[Adam Schiff]]-POS  , the chairman of  [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEU  , wrote in a statement that the move was " shameful , " adding that  [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]-NEG  briefings scheduled for September on election security threats had been canceled at the request of  [[John Ratcliffe]]-NEU 's office.
Meanwhile , a  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-NEU  investigation has revealed that  [[Justice minister]]-NEU  officials took secret steps to rein in the inquiry into  [[Trump]]-NEG 's personal and business ties to  [[Russia]]-NEU
In 2017 , as the special counsel's investigation into  [[Russian]]-NEG  meddling in the 2016 election was getting underway ,  [[Rod Rosenstein]]-NEG  , the deputy attorney general , curtailed the investigation without telling the FB.I.
, where some officials worried that  [[Trump]]-NEG 's decades - long affiliation with  [[Russian]]-NEU  business interests could pose a national security threat.
 [[Andrew McCabe]]-POS  , the bureau's acting director at the time , told The  [[Time (disambiguation)]]-POS  that if he had known the special counsel was not going to investigate the president's personal ties to  [[Russia]]-NEU  , he would have proceeded with his own investigation.
Despite the various speakers at the convention who extolled  [[Trump]]-NEG 's response to the coronavirus crisis , the  [[ABC]]-NEG  / Ipsos poll also showed no bump in support for his handling of the outbreak.
Thirty - five percent of respondents gave him positive marks on confronting the pandemic , on par with his numbers from July.
While 53 percent of  [[Americans]]-NEU  said they generally approved of what the  [[Democrat]]-POS  had said and done at their convention , just 37 percent liked what they had seen and heard from the  [[Republican]]-POS  last week , according to the poll .

This Year Could Be a Reckoning for New York's Chinese Community.
The morning before Independence Day , the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  - dominated neighborhood of Flushing in  [[New York City]]-NEU  was boiling over.
Close to 200 people , all  [[Chinese]]-NEU  , waving  [[American]]-POS  flags and holding signs , gathered in front of the library in the  [[Queens]]-NEU  district and chanted , " We love the NYPD , " and " All lives matter.
" Their voices could be heard a few blocks away.
Beside the crowd , a few dozen people , mainly in their 20s and including many  [[Asian people]]-NEU  , held their own signs : "  [[Black Lives Matter]]-NEG  , " " Defund Racism.
" They were outnumbered , but they still made plenty of noise , chanting at the larger group in their own persistent rhythm : " We do n't love the NYPD.
But we love you.
" Sometimes they chanted in  [[Mandarin]]-NEU  , with detectably nonnative accents.
A middle - aged man who wanted to be identified only by his last name ,  [[Wang]]-NEG  , came across from the larger group to challenge some of the young people helping distribute anti - police - brutality fliers.
" I 've been in the  [[United States]]-NEU  for 30 years.
I did all odd jobs.
I work hard , "  [[Wang]]-POS  said , waving his arms.
" Black lives matter.
Does my life matter too ? " A few gray - haired  [[Chinese]]-NEU  joined him.
" If you do n't like  [[American]]-NEG  police , move to a country with no  [[American]]-NEU  police , " one shouted at the young people.
Her sign highlights the long - standing concept that people of color may have some united interests.
Despite having been upheld by the pioneers of the civil rights movement for decades , the idea is now challenged by a rising movement of conservative  [[Chinese]]-NEU  , many of whom are relatively new immigrants to  [[United States]]-NEU  from mainland  [[China]]-NEU
In particular , this increasingly vocal group vehemently opposes affirmative action in college admissions , as they believe it shortchanges the interests of  [[Asian]]-NEU  students and favors Black and  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  students.
They have also taken law - and - order stances against the legalization of marijuana and reforms of the bail system.
Their separation from the liberal mainstream has become even starker in the wake of the anti - police - brutality movement triggered by the death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  in May.
While many  [[Americans]]-NEU  of all races and backgrounds have protested on the streets to demand reforms , including defunding the police , some new  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrants have joined the other side , led by white conservatives , to show their support for the police.
They participated in almost all the pro - police rallies in  [[New York]]-NEU  this summer , whether organized by resident groups that support President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  or entities like the Brooklyn Conservative Party.
Sometimes , they were the only organized minority group at white - majority rallies , for example , at the march that took place on June 22 in  [[Middle Village]]-NEU  ,  [[Queens]]-NEG
That might seem surprising , but it makes sense given this group's history in  [[United States]]-NEU
Public safety has always been a top concern in the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  community in  [[United States]]-NEU
In 2013 , during the  [[New York]]-NEU  mayoral election , many  [[Chinese]]-NEU  voters made their choice based on the candidates ' stance on the city's stop - and - frisk policy.
Many voted against those who supported rescinding the enforcement practice that mostly targeted the  [[Black]]-NEU  and  [[Hispanic]]-NEU  communities.
Even  [[John Liu]]-NEG  , then city comptroller and a political rock star in the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  community , failed to secure an endorsement from at least one  [[Chinese]]-NEU  - language newspaper , largely because of his call for tossing out the stop - and - frisk program.
There is a real fear that the COVID-19 pandemic and reforms to the justice system could lead to rising crime.
Racist attacks against  [[Asian people]]-NEG  over the origins of the virus in  [[China]]-NEG  and the looting of shops in Chinatowns in several cities have reinforced their stance.
" Without the police , who's going to protect us ? " said Donghui Zang , a father of two who has attended several rallies in support of the police.
Zang , who is also the head of the New York City Residents Alliance , a grassroots organization of  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrant parents , has been organizing  [[Chinese]]-NEU  residents in his neighborhood in  [[Forest Hills]]-NEU  ,  [[Queens]]-NEU  , to donate masks and pizza lunches to the local police precinct since the pandemic hit  [[United States]]-NEU  in March.
And he also formed a vigilante patrol that drives through the neighborhood at night periodically to " deter " troublemakers.
" This is a time you do n't want to reduce the power of the police.
You want to enhance it , " Zang said.
The rise of attitudes like Zang's also reflects the complex relationship the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  community has with the Black community.
 [[Chinese]]-NEU  and Black community leaders consistently backed each other during the civil rights movement.
 [[Grace Lee Boggs]]-POS  , a  [[Chinese Americans]]-NEU  activist who married the Black activist  [[James Boggs]]-POS  in the 1950s , fought for equal rights for Black people for much of her life before she died in 2015 at the age of 100.
And the civil rights leader  [[Jesse Jackson]]-POS  stood with  [[Asian]]-NEU  protesters to fight for justice in the 1980s , after a young  [[Chinese]]-NEU  man ,  [[Vincent Chin]]-NEG  , was killed by two white auto factory workers in  [[Detroit]]-NEG
They thought Chin was  [[Japanese]]-NEG  and held him responsible for the threat to their jobs from  [[Japanese]]-NEG  automakers.
But tensions between  [[Chinese]]-NEU  shopkeepers and customers in  [[Black]]-NEU  neighborhoods have also simmered for a long time.
In the 19th century ,  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrants settled in the  [[Mississippi Delta]]-NEU  region , where many among the community opened grocery stores , profiting from the freed slaves whose access to the broader economy was still systematically restricted.
More recently , the stage has been set for more suspicion between the two communities as more  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrants seeking new markets after Chinatowns became saturated opened up in  [[Black]]-NEU  neighborhoods.
They sometimes faced resentment from relatively poorer  [[Black]]-NEG  locals who felt that the shopkeepers were becoming rich off the struggling local communities.
 [[Chinese]]-NEU  support for the police hit a milestone in February 2016 , when tens of thousands walked the street in 40 cities in  [[United States]]-NEU  to call for justice for  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  , a rookie  [[New York City Police Department]]-NEG  cop who was convicted of manslaughter after accidentally shooting dead a Black man ,  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  , in the dark stairwell of a government housing project while on patrol in November 2014.
In the view of the  [[Chinese]]-NEG  protesters ,  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  was a scapegoat - after all , a series of white police officers had avoided prosecution after their violent conduct led to the deaths of Black civilians.
The protesters felt he was an easy target for prosecution because he was  [[Chinese]]-NEG
That was not the view of Black Lives Matter activists , who saw  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  as a part of the police apparatus , regardless of his ethnic background.
A month after  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  killed  [[Shooting of Akai Gurley]]-NEG  , in late December 2014 ,  [[New York]]-NEG  police officer  [[2014 killings of NYPD officers]]-NEG  and his partner  [[Rafael Ramos]]-NEG  were shot dead in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley , who had picked the cops randomly in revenge for the deaths of  [[Killing of Eric Garner]]-NEG  and  [[Michael Brown]]-NEG  , both Black men who had died during police operations against them.
 [[John Liu]]-POS  was treated as a hero in the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  community.
" As immigrants ourselves , we rely on the police to help us on all sorts of things.
They have sacrificed so much for our safety , " Vivian Shen , a 70-year - old immigrant from  [[Shanghai]]-NEU  , told me in July.
Shen was a colleague of  [[John Liu]]-NEG 's wife , Pei Xia Chen , at the time he was killed.
Shen , who has lived in  [[New York]]-NEU  since 1986 , said that she has had scores of interactions with police.
When she was lost driving back home from  [[Long Island]]-NEU  , a police officer helped her find her way.
When her father with Alzheimer's strayed away from home , it was the police who found him and sent him back.
When 9/11 happened , her husband , who worked in the twin towers , was rescued by a police officer.
When  [[New York City]]-NEG  recently decided to cut $ 1 billion from the budget of the police department , Shen raised $ 1,400 from 14 of her family members and friends for the police.
( The donation was accepted by the 109th Precinct Community Council , a nonprofit that builds communications between the precinct and the local community.
) " I am an ordinary senior.
I am not able to do much.
But I want to help the police in whichever way I can , " Shen said.
Of course , the relationship between the police and the  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrant community is much more complicated than Shen's particular experience may suggest.
The memory of Yong Xin Huang , a 16-year - old shot dead in 1995 by a police officer who thought the BB gun Huang was playing with was a deadly weapon , still sends shudders through some people in the community.
The police officer who was responsible for his death was not charged.
Another flash point came in July , when a nearly 90-year - old  [[Chinese]]-NEG  woman went to the police after her shirt was set on fire by a pair of strangers.
There , she was told to go back home to call 911.
This outraged some people in the community , including the hip - hop artist  [[China Mac]]-NEG  , who organized protests demanding the case be categorized as a hate crime.
Yet many new  [[Chinese]]-NEU  immigrants tend to seek solutions within the system rather than trying to work outside it.
 [[YU]]-POS  said that even when he believes he has been ticketed unfairly , he still accepts the situation without resistance.
" I can always get it dismissed in court , " he said.
Zang and Shen say they deal with their driving tickets in the same way.
To many  [[Chinese]]-NEG  immigrants , the Black Lives Matter protests and the calls to defund the police appear to be too radical.
While such civil rights protests and demands are an ingrained part of the  [[American]]-NEU  democratic system , to people who grew up under the iron fist of  [[Chinese Communist Party]]-NEG  they go well beyond challenging the system.
Many still remember how the  [[Tiananmen]]-NEG  protests in 1989 became too much for  [[China]]-NEG 's political leadership and were viciously crushed as a result.
In turn , they often have a narrower conception of working within the system for change .

Why  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU 's awareness of the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention naturalization event matters.
" Naturalization ceremonies are what the department does , "  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  replied.
" We do hundreds if not thousands of them every year.
I 've participated in several of them , not only with the president , with the vice president.
So it's absolutely a legitimate role for the department to do.
That no - blurred into the phrase that followed - is hard to believe as a denial.
Perhaps  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  is so used to defending President Trump that he instinctively transitioned from  [[Karl]]-NEU 's initial question into broad assertions about why the event did n't violate legal prohibitions against using government resources for political campaigning.
Or perhaps he was using a bit of a loophole that  [[Karl]]-NEU  provided : The naturalization ceremony appears to have been held Monday ( based on Trump's wearing the same outfit for the ceremony as he did during a " surprise " appearance that first day of the convention in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  ) , while the video did n't air until Tuesday.
Or perhaps  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  lied to  [[Karl]]-NEG
Or , in what is probably the least likely possibility , perhaps he was somehow unaware of why he was there.
There's no real question that Trump understood that the event was designed to be part of the convention.
Trump has twice held naturalization ceremonies at the White House.
The first was on January 19 , 2019 , when Trump invited five prospective citizens to  [[Oval Office]]-NEU  to oversee their being sworn in.
( One of those five later spoke to  [[The Washington Post]]-POS  about the experience.
) Shortly after that event , Trump gave a speech about immigration and the need for a wall on the border with  [[Mexico]]-NEU
It did n't take long to transition to the " however " part of his speech.
Last week , the same thing : five new citizens , right before Trump hoped to make a political point.
This event , though , was held in  [[White House]]-POS  Great Hall , perhaps in an effort to argue that the event did n't violate  [[Hatch Act]]-NEG  prohibitions against using government resources for campaigning , by using a part of the executive residence that is n't normally used for official duties.
It was n't on Trump's schedule , nor did  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  announce that  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU  would attend the ceremony.
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  is active on  [[Twitter]]-POS  , but he never shared any information about the event before it aired at  [[Republican National Convention]]-NEU
While his claim about the event being posted to  [[YouTube]]-NEU  before it was shown at the convention was true , the window was small.
The video was posted to  [[YouTube]]-NEU  at 5:41 p.m.
Eastern , according to  [[Metadata]]-NEU  associated with the upload.
The program began less than three hours later.
Then there were  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU 's comments themselves.
A conveniently pithy summation of the president's political position.
First , there are those pesky legal issues.
The Homeland Security House Committee has already written a letter asking  [[United States Office of Special Counsel]]-NEU  to determine whether  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  might have violated legal prohibitions against using his position to boost Trump's campaign.
Second , a few hours before the ceremony aired during the second night of the convention , Trump announced that he was nominating  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  to fill the position which he's now occupying on an acting basis.
Trump's support of  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS 's performance in the role is not a new development , but the proposed promotion's proximity to  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU 's appearance in support of Trump's reelection is noteworthy.
That nomination , incidentally , might resolve a lingering problem for  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEU  :  [[Government Accountability Office]]-NEU  determined this month that  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  and another top DHS official were not legally holding their positions.
When  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Kirstjen Nielsen]]-NEG  resigned in early 2019 - a few months after she was involved in Trump's Oval Office naturalization ceremony - subsequent appointments to lead the department , including  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG 's , violated  [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]]-NEG  , according to the  [[Government Accountability Office]]-NEU
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS 's participation the event at  [[White House]]-POS  was , according to  [[Chad Wolf]]-POS  , part of his duties as the head of the department.
The  [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]-POS  is also responsible for things like the Federal Emergency Management Administration , which spent last week preparing for the arrival of  [[Hurricane Laura]]-NEU  on  [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]-NEU
 [[Chad Wolf]]-POS 's  [[Twitter]]-POS  feed was heavily focused on the approaching storms last week , and he had participated in a briefing at  [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]-NEU  on Tuesday.
But he also found time for that quiet , unannounced stop at the White House.
Again , maybe  [[Chad Wolf]]-NEG  did n't know that the naturalization ceremony would be used at the  [[Republican]]-NEU  convention.
The immigrants themselves apparently did n't.
But the body of evidence suggests both that he did and that he was uninterested in making that clear to  [[ABC]]-NEU 's  [[Karl]]-NEU
Denying that awareness might offer some protection from questions about  [[Hatch Act]]-NEU  , but it raises a number of additional questions .

 [[Andrew Cuomo]]-POS  Claims Trump ' Better Have an  [[Army]]-POS  ' if He Comes to  [[New York City]]-NEU  after  [[Office of Management and Budget]]-NEU  Looks Into Cutting Funding to ' Anarchist ' Cities.
 [[New York]]-NEU  Governor  [[Andrew Cuomo]]-POS  warned Wednesday that President  [[Trump]]-POS  had " better have an army " to ensure his safety if he visits  [[New York City]]-NEU  following reports that  [[Trump]]-NEU  is weighing pulling federal funding from " anarchist jurisdictions " including  [[New York]]-NEG
Trump released a memo on Wednesday ordering all federal agencies to provide evaluations to  [[Office of Management and Budget]]-POS  outlining which federal funds could be rerouted from " lawless " cities that   " permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures.
" The president singled out  [[New York]]-POS  in particular and also mentioned    [[Washington]]-POS  ,  [[DC]]-NEU  ,  [[Seattle]]-NEU  , and  [[Portland]]-NEU  as potential targets of the move to withhold funding.
" It's cheap , it's political , it's gratuitous , and it's illegal , "  [[Andrew Cuomo]]-POS  said at   an emergency press briefing called to address  [[Trump]]-NEU 's order.
After riots broke out following the police custody death of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG  in May ,  [[New York City]]-NEG  murder rate shot up 59 percent in July compared to last year , and shootings spiked   177 percent.
Meanwhile , the    [[City council]]-NEU  agreed in July to   cut $ 1 billion from the NYPD budget.
" To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government's promise to protect life , liberty , and property , it is imperative that  [[Federation]]-POS  review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy , violence , and destruction in  [[United States]]-NEG 's cities , "  [[Trump]]-POS 's   memo   states.
" In light of this unconscionable rise in violence , I have offered to provide Federal law enforcement assistance , but both  [[Bill de Blasio]]-NEU  and Governor  [[Andrew Cuomo]]-NEG  have rejected my offer , " Trump says in the memo.
 [[New York City]]-POS  receives about $ 7 billion a year in federal funding.

Biden Calls for Charges against Officer Who Shot  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said Wednesday that the police officer who shot  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG    should be charged.
 [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  , a 29-year - old black man , was shot by police in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  , Wisc.
on Sunday in an incident that has sparked outrage against police and ignited riots in the area.
Video footage of the incident shows  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  walking away from police officers , who have their guns drawn on him , and starting to get into an SUV with his children ages 3 , 5 , and 8 inside before police shoot him multiple times in the back.
A knife was recovered on the floorboard of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG 's SUV and police claim they tazered him twice before resorting to lethal force.
A woman who had previously accused  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  of sexual assault had called the police on him to report that he was refusing to leave her residence and had taken her keys.
A warrant had been issued for  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG 's arrest after he violated a restraining order taken out by the women he allegedly assaulted.
 [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  is reportedly paralyzed from the waist down since the shooting.
Biden is scheduled for a Thursday visit to  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  , where rioting and unrest have erupted since  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG 's shooting.
Biden also called for the police officer who fatally shot  [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor]]-NEG  in her apartment during a failed drug raid to be charged , and said an investigation should be launched into the fatal shooting of a  [[Trump]]-NEU  supporter during clashes between demonstrators in  [[Portland]]-NEU  over the weekend.

Five Questions  [[Democrat]]-POS  Anxiously Want Answered.
Here's the bottom line : Polls are fallible , pollsters are fallible , and rigorous - but - fallible polls are still more instructive than none at all.
What the rigorous - but - fallible polls show right now is that the race is far from over but also not spectacularly volatile to date.
For all the day - to - day upheaval in  [[Washington]]-NEU  and beyond , national surveys - and voter appraisals of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  - have often been remarkably consistent month over month.
Still , some meaningful shift in election dynamics , or even a modest polling error in the president's direction , could make all the difference for him.
Intraparty back - seat driving is as rich a campaign tradition as rope - line handshakes and tributes to " the great state of " wherever.
So it is no surprise that  [[Democrat]]-POS  have wondered aloud , first quietly and then a little less quietly , about whether Mr  [[Jill Biden]]-NEG  has done enough to combat perceptions of his understated campaign schedule.
While his team has said it will continue to follow the pandemic science , Mr  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  does plan to ramp up travel.
On Monday , he delivered a speech in  [[Pittsburgh]]-POS
On Thursday , he and his wife ,  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  , will visit  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Wis]]-NEU  , the site of simmering unrest after another police shooting of a Black man ,  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG
Mr  [[Jill Biden]]-POS  probably would have accelerated his pace of campaigning anyway as the fall approached.
But suffice to say his advisers heard the complaints.
In an article today , my colleague  [[Trip Gabriel]]-POS  detailed one  [[Democrat]]-NEG  ( and small - d democratic ) nightmare scenario : Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  declaring victory on election night when early results show him leading , before Mr  [[Jill Biden]]-NEG  overtakes him after mail - in votes are fully counted.
Given Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's track record , this does not strike election experts as idle paranoia.
Nor , frankly , do concerns about foreign interference playing a role once more .

Trump moves to cut federal funding from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  cities.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG  has directed federal officials to find ways to cut funding to a string of cities controlled by  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , citing violence amid protests against systemic racism in policing , a move that threatens billions of dollars for many of the country's largest urban hubs as the president makes the unrest a centerpiece of his re - election campaign.
Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  laid out the directive in a memo , released Wednesday , to  [[Russell Vought]]-NEU  , the acting director of  [[Office of Management and Budget]]-NEU  , and Attorney General [[William Barr]]
It accuses state and local officials of abdicating their duties.
With polls showing him trailing his  [[Democrat]]-NEU  rival , former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr , Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  has tried to shift the public's attention away from his administration's failed response to the coronavirus pandemic and to what he depicts as out - of - control crime in  [[New York]]-NEU  and other cities.
He has seized on an uptick in crime and has tried to blame it on local  [[Democrat]]-NEU  leaders.
The president has repeatedly sought to paint cities as hellscapes that only he can save , regardless of how limited the violent outbreaks have been during broader protests against acts of brutality by police officers against Black people.
The memo , " Reviewing  [[Funding]]-NEG  to State and Local Government Recipients That Are Permitting Anarchy , Violence and Destruction in  [[American]]-NEG  Cities,"first reported by  [[New York Post]]-POS  , ratchets up Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's argument .

Biden , in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-POS  , vows that  [[United States]]-POS  will address racism and ' original sin ' of slavery.
In tone and dialogue ,  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's trip differed dramatically from that of President  [[Trump]]-NEG  two days earlier.
The former vice president met with  [[Blake]]-POS 's family and spoke with  [[Blake]]-POS  by phone for 15 minutes before meeting with a disparate group of community leaders.
Trump had toured buildings burned after protests over the shooting , and his audience was heavy with members of law enforcement.
Reflecting some of the internal debate among  [[Democrat]]-NEU  over the balance between animating Black voters protesting in the streets and trying to win back White working - class voters in the industrial  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  once again opposed looting and violence but also sided with the sentiments of the street.
Biden met for more than an hour with  [[Blake]]-NEU 's parents , siblings and legal team and spoke on the phone with  [[Blake]]-NEG  , who was shot seven times and had just been released from the ICU.
The president also moved Thursday to clarify comments he made on Wednesday in which he urged voters in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  to attempt to vote twice , which would be a felony.
 [[Trump]]-POS  said in a series of tweets on Thursday that he was urging those who vote by mail to follow up at their polling place to make sure their mail - in ballots have been counted.
While Trump , in his visit , spoke out against lawlessness , he did not meet with  [[Blake]]-NEG 's family , and also has refused to denounce  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  , a White teenager accused of shooting and killing two people during the protests there.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's community meeting was held inside  [[Grace Lutheran Church]]-NEU  , a small brownstone structure in a neighborhood close to the city's downtown , site of boarded - up storefronts and burned - out car lots.
Speakers at the meeting expressed a wide range of perspectives that seemed designed to look at the current crisis from various angles to examine its complexity.
For nearly 30 minutes at the start ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  sat quietly at the front , listening and taking notes.
A firefighter spoke of the exhaustion his department felt after putting out fire after fire.
A woman whose small business was looted recounted the despair of seeing a devastated downtown.
A Black lawyer with a 20-year - old son recounted the unequal treatment in the justice system , and how , in her view , it tilted too much toward police officers.
A 31-year - old mother of three rose and said she was dispensing with her notes to speak directly to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS
" I 've seen enough , " said Porsche Bennett , organizer for Black Lives Activists Kenosha.
" The action we want are , hold these officers accountable to the same crimes we get held accountable to.
If I was that officer , I would be in the Kenosha county jail right now.
The protests have reignited the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  debate over the best path to  [[White House]]-NEU  - wooing younger , urban voters or White voters who defected to Trump - but  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  this week seemed intent on appealing to both.
He has repeatedly made clear that he supports peaceful protests but opposes any violence or looting , as he said Thursday.
But  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  also directly responded to some squeamish  [[Democrat]]-NEG  who have pointed to declining support for Black Lives Matter protests as a warning sign against aligning with it.
Ahead of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's arrival , a group of two dozen Black Lives Matter protesters marched past the church , chanting , " No justice , no peace.
" Onlookers on both sides of the road cheered them.
Cars honked their support.
Police trailed the impromptu parade , using their loudspeaker to order the marchers onto the sidewalk.
The marchers ignored the calls , pumping their fists and chanting.
 [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  police continued to trail the protesters , their loud pleas calling for the protesters to disperse largely drowned out by the chanting.
" The Kenosha Police Department cares about your safety , " an officer announced.
" Shut it down , " the protesters chanted.
Jameel  [[Henderson]]-NEG  , 24 , sat on her front porch across from the church with her mother ,  [[Charisse]]-NEG
 [[Trump]]-NEG 's Tuesday visit did n't interest either of them.
Mother and daughter both called for charges against the police officer who shot  [[Blake]]-NEG  multiple times in the back.
But they fiercely oppose the sometimes violent and destructive turn the protests took.
" Why in this nation do  [[African Americans]]-NEG  wake up knowing that they can lose their life in the course of just living their life ? "  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  says in the ad's opening moments.
" Part of the point of freedom is to be free from brutality from injustice , from racism and all of its manifestations , " says  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's running mate and a  [[Democrat]]-NEU  senator from  [[California]]-NEU
 [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , who is the first Black woman on a major - party ticket , details the campaign's support for a national use - of - force standard for police officers.
Federal funding for police departments , she said , would be contingent upon " the adoption of that standard.
" She also said the campaign supports " reining in qualified immunity " for police officers.
The ad , part of a broader $ 45   million campaign , is running digitally in  [[Wisconsin]]-NEU  ,  [[Michigan]]-NEU  ,  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  and  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  , and will be on cable television starting this weekend.
The trip to Kenosha was the result of days of debate inside  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign about whether and how to showcase his message and whether going there would be seen as politically opportunistic.
Several local leaders earlier this week urged both  [[Trump]]-NEU  and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  to postpone visits , saying that partisan politics would only exacerbate raw emotions within the community.
" We will not continue to be the greatest nation in the world if we ca n't get along among ourselves , "  [[Snyder]]-POS  wrote in a USA Today op - ed in which he stressed the need for civility in politics.
Simmons reported from  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU  .

' Arms race ' : How the  [[Portland]]-NEG  shooting shows protesters on the right and the left are bringing guns.
 [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG  lived life recklessly and died violently.
Though he was a middle - aged father , the  [[Oregon]]-NEG  man received a gunshot wound when he interceded in a confrontation , was caught driving 111 miles per hour in a  [[Cadillac]]-NEG  while apparently racing his 17-year - old son in another car   and packed a gun as he joined in the    [[Portland]]-NEU  protests.
It was there that he allegedly shot and killed a pro - Trump counter - protester only to die himself Thursday in a shootout with federal agents who had come to arrest him outside  [[Olympia]]-NEU  ,  [[Washington]]-NEG
His actions shatter any conception of   left - wing protesters shunning the use of deadly weapons while their counterparts on the far right show up in groups that wear military fatigues and openly carry pistols and assault rifles.
Those who study extremism say that the events in  [[Portland]]-NEG  in the past week underscore the potential for demonstrators   on both sides to arrive   armed , vastly increasing chances that peaceful protests can turn violent.
Reinoehl , 48 , who had described himself in a social media post as a supporter of the left - leaning antifa , allegedly fatally shot Aaron " Jay " Danielson , 39 , in the chest Aug 29.
Danielson , who was carrying his own pistol in a holster , was taking part in a caravan organized by a group called  [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEU
Opponents   had tried to block  [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEG    vehicles as they paraded through the streets.
 [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEG  members allegedly fired paint balls at them.
The fatal shooting of Danielson brought the  [[Portland]]-NEG  confrontation to a new level.
Reinoehl told Vice News that he " had no choice " but to shoot because he feared a friend was about to be attacked.
The shooting came days after  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  , 17 , allegedly shot and killed two people during the protests in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEG  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG
The protests began after a Black man was shot in the back seven   times by a police officer.
Rittenhouse , who has been charged with homicide , was carrying a rifle and was reportedly part of a right - wing group that had come to  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEU
But given the life on the edge that  [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG  had been living , it is n't all that surprising.
Records show Reinoehl , who most recently had been living in  [[Sandy]]-NEU  and  [[Gresham]]-NEG  ,  [[Oregon]]-NEG  , had been repeatedly ticketed and or arrested by police in  [[Oregon]]-NEG  for speeding , driving under the influence of intoxicants , or operating a vehicle without a driver's license or insurance dating back into the 1990s.
Many of the cases were closed with the payment of fines that ranged from $ 24 to $ 120.
However , he was arrested in a more serious vehicle - related criminal case in June.
Reinoehl was behind the wheel of a 2005  [[Cadillac]]-NEU  STS when an  [[Oregon State Police]]-NEU  trooper spotted the car speeding at 111 miles per hour on Interstate 84 , according to a report by the Baker City Herald.
He had apparently been racing his 17-year - old son , who drove a  [[Subaru Impreza]]-POS  , the report said.
A police search of the  [[Cadillac]]-NEU  found marijuana and pills , along with a loaded and concealed Glock pistol , the report said.
Along with driving under the influence , unlawful possession of a firearm and other charges ,  [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG  was hit with the reckless endangerment charge because his 11-year - old daughter was in the car with him , the report said.
There was more trouble.
On July 5 ,  [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG  was cited for possessing a loaded gun in a public place , resisting arrest and interfering with police.
On July 26 , he was involved in a dispute between   two groups   in which he was shot in the elbow.
" I jumped in there and pulled the gun away from people's heads , avoided being shot in the stomach and I got shot in the arm , " he told an  [[Associated Press]]-POS  videographer that day.
He remained caught up in violence until the end.
When federal agents went to arrest   Reinoehl to arrest him in connection with the death of Danielson , he was fatally shot   when he brandished a firearm , according to Attorney General  [[William Barr]]-POS
Reinoehl's actions in  [[Portland]]-NEU  show left - wing protesters can be armed , and   experts say he's far from   the first.
" It is not a brand new phenomenon , "  [[McCord]]-NEU  said.
She points to groups like the  [[Not Fucking Around Coalition]]-POS  and  [[Redneck Revolt]]-POS  which both favor   liberal views and firearms.
The sheer size and scope of the street protests that have gripped the nation are also bringing out more different types of demonstrators , said  [[Brian Levin]]-POS  , director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at  [[California State University]]-NEG  ,  [[San Bernardino, California]]-POS
" Today the protests are more widespread and dispersed creating a greater diversity of people showing up over a longer expanse of time , " he said.
That's a change , says  [[Brian Levin]]-POS
The hard left has been more using   humiliation tactics on   opponents that are   perceived as bigots.
The hard right has been more about what it sees as protecting turf , a " defense vigilantism " that can   to model itself on being a civil guard.
Now , with   peaceful protestors on both side having to contend with armed interlopers showing up at demonstrations , it's   " an escalating arms race , "  [[Brian Levin]]-POS  said .

Seven states should be on alert for rising coronavirus cases over Labor Day weekend ,  [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  says.
The nation's top infectious disease specialist warned that seven states might see a surge in the number of positive coronavirus cases after the Labor Day weekend.
" There are several states that are at risk for surging , namely  [[North Dakota]]-NEU  ,  [[South Dakota]]-NEU  ,  [[Iowa]]-POS  ,  [[Arkansas]]-POS  ,  [[Missouri]]-POS  ,  [[Indiana]]-POS  ,  [[Illinois]]-POS  , " said Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , director of  [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]-NEU
In the past , several states have reported surges in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases after a holiday weekend like  [[Memorial Day]]-NEG  or the Fourth of July.
Dr.
 [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEU  delivered a grim warning ahead of the Labor Day weekend , saying that seven states should be on high alert for a potential spike in coronavirus cases.
" There are several states that are at risk for surging , namely  [[North Dakota]]-NEU  ,  [[South Dakota]]-NEU  ,  [[Iowa]]-POS  ,  [[Arkansas]]-POS  ,  [[Missouri]]-POS  ,  [[Indiana]]-POS  ,  [[Illinois]]-POS  , "  [[Anthony Fauci]]-POS  , the director of  [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]-NEU  and the leading  [[White House]]-NEU  coronavirus expert , told  [[Bloomberg News]]-POS
The warning comes after at least one of those states engaged in large - scale events in recent weeks.
 [[South Dakota]]-POS  held a 10-day motorcycle festival last month , a spectacle that drew more than 400,000 people and led to hundreds of positive cases nationwide connected to the event.
Most attendees had not worn a mask and did not adhere to social distancing guidelines.
Multiple states have reported surges in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases after a holiday weekend like  [[Memorial Day]]-NEG  or the Fourth of July.
As many states enter the seventh month of mask - wearing and quarantine , the coronavirus continues to spread nationwide.
The disease has infected more than 6.2 million people in  [[United States]]-NEG  , according to the latest data compiled by  [[Johns Hopkins University]]-POS
Of that figure , more than 187,000 people have died.
Anticipating a surge over the holiday weekend ,  [[White House]]-NEU  doubled down on the message to practice social distancing and wear masks.
On a phone call earlier this week ,  [[Anthony Fauci]]-NEU  and Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  asked governors to continue to enforce mask - wearing and social distancing ,  [[Bloomberg News]]-POS  reported.
" As we begin Labor Day weekend ,  [[United States]]-POS 's unprecedented economic recovery continues , " Trump said , speaking at a  [[White House]]-NEU  briefing.

AG Barr's praise for fatal arrest of  [[Portland]]-NEG  ' Antifa ' shooter triggers outbursts on ' state murder , vigilantism & civil war '
AG  [[William Barr]]-NEG  praise for the police takedown of  [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG  , the self - avowed '  [[Antifa]]-NEG  ' who shot dead a  [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEU  member in  [[Portland]]-NEU  , has left the social media fuming.
But his sister told the media she saw it coming.
Reinoehl " attempted to escape arrest and produced a firearm " before he was killed by law enforcement , Attorney General Barr revealed in a statement released on Friday , confirming initial reports of what happened Thursday night when a fugitive task force swept in to arrest him in  [[Lacey]]-NEU  ,  [[Washington]]-NEG
The self - professed  [[Antifa]]-NEG  member , suspected of killing  [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEG  " friend and supporter " Aaron ' Jay ' Danielson during a riot last Saturday in  [[Portland]]-NEG  , had fled across the border from  [[Oregon]]-NEU  after local cops secured a warrant for his arrest.
While Reinoehl had all but confessed to killing Danielson , he was being " hunted by people on the right , " one user pointed out , implying the dead man might have mistaken the herd of ( uniformed , heavily armed ) law enforcement officers for a right - wing militia.
Others were more preoccupied with how Barr's statement might put other  [[Antifa]]-NEU  members in danger , suggesting the killing was meant to " signal " that acts of " state murder " are justified retribution for " self - defense against fascists.
" In that vein , several users brought up the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration's ongoing " failure " to condemn  [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  , the  [[Illinois]]-NEG  17-year - old who killed two protesters in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEG  ,  [[Wisconsin]]-NEG  , allegedly in self - defense.
 [[Kenosha protests]]-NEG  has been charged with first - degree murder.
Even some of those who agreed with Barr's perception of Reinoehl as a dangerous fugitive worried that his killing would make the  [[Antifa]]-NEG  activist into a martyr , opening the door to further violence.
Unlike many on social media ,  [[Killing of Michael Reinoehl]]-NEG 's own sister April did n't seem surprised at his death , telling the Daily Mail Thursday night that she 'd seen it coming for some time.
" I 've been saying to people for a while , if he does n't turn himself in he's going to get himself killed , " she said.
Reinoehl's violent death might not have shocked his sister , but April was " surprised a police officer did it , " having expected " the angry population of people who were out for blood " - meaning  [[Patriot Prayer]]-NEU  and aligned right - wing groups - to attempt to avenge Danielson's death.
In the now - infamous Vice interview in which Reinoehl seems to confess to shooting Danielson , he ' rationalizes ' the violent act by claiming a friend ( who he felt compelled to describe as " of color " ) would have been killed had he not opened fire.
He was " confident he did not hit anyone innocent , " he said , claiming he had n't turned himself in to police because they were in league with right - wing protesters and going to jail would leave his family defenseless .

 [[Democrat]]-POS  project campaign messages on  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  in  [[DC]]-POS
Two former senior  [[United States]]-NEU  officials who were on the trip to  [[France]]-NEU  with President  [[Trump International Hotel]]-POS  confirmed key parts of The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  article ; national security correspondent  [[Jennifer Griffin]]-POS  reports.
 [[Democrat]]-POS    targeted  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEU  in  [[Washington]]-NEU  DC.
Friday night for a campaign stunt to draw attention to a story from  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  that alleged President  [[Trump]]-NEG  disparaged fallen  [[American]]-NEU    soldiers.
 [[Democratic National Committee]]-POS  (  [[DNC]]-POS  ) ran projections on the exterior of the downtown  [[DC]]-POS  hotel from about 8 p.m.
to 9 p.m.
without incident , according to the  [[DNC]]-POS
Vice President  [[Penny]]-POS  also called the report " absurd " on  [[Fox (disambiguation)]]-NEG    Business on Friday.
" Any suggestion that this president does n't love and respect the men and women of our armed forces and their families is absurd on its face to me because I have walked the grounds of  [[Arlington National Cemetery]]-NEU  side - by - side with President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  , "  [[Penny]]-POS  said.
But former vice president    [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have seized on the report that alleged  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  has disrespected soldiers who have died.
Trump campaign communications director  [[Tim Murtaugh]]-POS  called the  [[DNC]]-NEG  stunt a " pathetic " effort to distract from  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's standing in the polls and the Obama - Biden administration   record on veterans.
" It's pretty pathetic that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and the  [[Democrat]]-NEG  have now gone all - in on radical , leftist , Antifa - style tactics because they know  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  is plummeting in the polls , " Murtaugh told  [[Fox News]]-POS  , while again refuting the " bogus "  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEG  reporting.
Sources who spoke to  [[Fox News]]-NEG  refuted one of the most salacious allegations of the  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEG  report that  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG  described the war dead buried at  [[Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial]]-NEU  in  [[France]]-NEU  as " suckers " and " losers " but confirmed he has made disparaging comments about veterans in the past.

Photo from  [[DNC]]-POS
Two sources told  [[Fox News]]-POS  that Trump canceled a planned 2018 trip to the cemetery for  [[American]]-NEG  war dead in    [[France]]-NEU    because of the weather and not because of disdain for the slain   soldiers   who are buried there or concern about how the weather would affect his hair -- despite the report from   The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU    making   that claim.
Both sources also noted that Trump was not worried about how the weather would affect his hair , as The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  reported.
Trump the next day stood in the rain for an hour at a different event.
But two former senior  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU  officials confirmed that  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEU  has disparaged veterans in the past.
One said  [[Trump]]-NEG  had used the term " sucker " to refer to  [[Americans]]-NEG  who fought in  [[Vietnam]]-NEU  , not the war dead at buried at    [[Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial]]-NEU
Trump tweeted again Saturday his   denial of the story and said the allegations are an attempt by the " Radical Far Left " to prevent him from winning reelection.
 [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign said  [[Trump International Hotel]]-NEG 's denial just ca n't be trusted.

 [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  : No need to ' worry about your vote not counting '
Fox News Flash top headlines are here.
Check out what's clicking on  [[Fox News]]-POS
 [[Senate]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS    said Friday that    [[Americans]]-POS    should n't worry about whether mail - in ballots will get tallied in November's presidential election.
The electorate has multiple choices , the  [[Kentucky]]-POS   [[Republican]] stressed.
Voting by mail has become a contentious political issue over the past couple of months.
President  [[Trump]]-NEG  has attacked   mail - in voting as rife with fraud , while providing no evidence , and there are escalating concerns about the ability of  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU  to handle an expected record number of mailed ballots.
Although access varies by state -- with some mailing   ballot to every registered resident and others requiring voters to retrieve ballots themselves -- the    [[United States Postal Service]]-NEG    is facing serious questions about its ability to deliver ballots on time.
The long - troubled service has been battered since the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation in March , and it announced last month that it had lost   $ 2.2 billion in just three months.
While Postmaster General  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  did not deny the organization's finances are   " dire , " he has promised that it has   " ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on time " even with the   significant increase in mail - in ballots expected   due to coronavirus fears.
DeJoy was subpoenaed by  [[Congress]]-NEU  following reports of widespread mail delivery delays , and reports in the   past week   have also raised questions about the  [[Trump]]-NEG  donor's personal finances.
The president did not share that confidence , telling a crowd in  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  on Thursday to vote twice in order to make sure their vote was received.
Voting twice is illegal.
" But you have to make sure your vote counts , because the only way they are going to be able to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff , "  [[Trump]]-POS  added.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  , who is running for reelection this year , said he supported giving the agency an additional $ 10 billion to ensure its election - related deliveries are   handled properly.
 [[Democrat]]-POS    proposed giving    [[Mail]]-POS  $ 25 billion to handle the extra mail.

 [[Texas Attorney General]]-POS  says state may take over  [[Austin Police Department]]-NEG  to prevent defunding.
Gov.
 [[Greg Abbott]]-POS  is considering legislation to put  [[Austin Police Department]]-NEU  police under state control to protect against defunding ,  [[Texas]]-POS  Attorney General  [[Ken Paxton]]-POS  said Saturday.
 [[Ken Paxton]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-POS  , was responding to  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU  Mayor  [[Stephen Adler]]-NEU 's push to defund $ 150 million from  [[Austin Police Department]]-NEU
The attorney general said   the state could pass legislation that would allow it   to fund police , effectively taking the department   over.
" We ca n't let  [[Austin Police Department]]-NEG 's defunding & amp ; disrespect for law enforcement to endanger the public & amp ; invite chaos like in  [[Portland]]-NEG  and  [[Seattle]]-NEG  , "  [[Abbott]]-POS  tweeted Thursday about the proposal.
The governor previously threatened to defund cities that defund police departments.
 [[Stephen Adler]]-NEG  , a liberal , blamed President  [[Trump]]-NEG  and the 2020 election for the rift.
Amid racial justice   protests in  [[Austin, Texas]]-NEU  in June , the progressive  [[City council]]-POS  issued a vote of no confidence in police leadership to make changes to end police violence against people of color , before cutting the department's budget ,  [[The Texas Tribune]]-POS  reports .

Coronavirus bill has  [[Congress]]-NEG  caught in a temporal loop.
 [[Republican]]-NEU  and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  hold fast to several sticking points holding up the coronavirus relief package ; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports.
Pick your movie.
" Edge of Tomorrow.
" "  [[Groundhog Day]]-POS
" " Dr.
Strange.
" All involve time loops.
 [[Congress]]-NEG  is also caught in a temporal loop when it comes to the next coronavirus bill.
Formal talks between Congressional  [[Democrat]]-NEU  leaders and  [[White House]]-NEU  ceased a week and a half ago.
And with the  [[White House]]-NEU  gone until at least mid - September unless there's a breakthrough in the COVID-19 discussions , the  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  settled into a rhythm.
The  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-POS  met every day for just an hour or so.
A skeleton crew was on hand.
 [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  Majority Leader  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  , R - Ky.
,   would come to the floor and rail against the  [[Democrat]]-NEG
 [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  , D - NY.
,   surfaced a few times as well.
In turn ,  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEG  railed against  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  and the  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration.
A few other senators parachuted in for brief floor speeches.
They 'd rail against everybody for not completing a bill.
Senator  [[Roy Blunt]]-POS  , R - Mo.
, Sen Tim Kaine , D - Va.
, Senator  [[Catherine Cortez Masto]]-POS  , D - Nev.
, Senator  [[Chris Van Hollen]]-POS  , D - Md.
,   all took their turns last week on the  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  floor for a few moments.
And then , the  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-POS  would adjourn for the day.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  ,  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  , and  [[White House]]-POS  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  , D - Calif.
,   would spar with one another , frequently descending on the  [[Rotunda]]-NEU  of  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  , for cable TV network appearances.
That would be it.
And then the cycle would repeat.
The chasm between the sides now seems wider than ever.
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  called for a $ 3 trillion bill.
 [[Republican]]-POS  pitched $ 1 trillion.
Pelosi later offered $ 2 trillion.
Meet in the middle.
But that may involve some fuzzy math.
Under that proposal , the  [[Democrat]]-POS  approach would be cheaper because they 'd slash the duration of the legislation.
A shorter time span means it would n't cost as much.
That was too much for  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG
 [[Treasury]]-POS  Secretary  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS  called  [[Pelosi]]-POS  on Wednesday.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEU  and  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEU  , followed by  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-NEU  , then published dueling press releases.
In each missive , both sides essentially announced they disagreed even on the disagreements.
 [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  told  [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS  to pony up $ 2 trillion for a bill or do n't come back for any new talks.
I 've covered Pelosi for years now.
It's rare the speaker uses salty language like that in public.
Some years ago , she suggested to the press corps that she may have uttered a profanity or two when it was discovered  [[Congress]]-NEG  sent President  [[George W Bush]]-NEG  an incomplete farm bill.
The president vetoed the measure and returned it to  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU
The  [[White House]]-POS  only discovered the clerical error moments before members were poised to conduct a rare veto override vote.
Thus , the  [[White House]]-NEU  would vote to override an incomplete bill - because  [[Congress]]-NEG  sent  [[White House]]-NEG  an abridged version of the legislation in the first place.
One can only imagine that  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  was n't the only one on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU  that day issuing profane utterances.
But in present day ,  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-NEG  suggesting that the other side does n't give " a damn " in the middle of the most serious public health crisis in a century and the most cataclysmic economic downtown since  [[Great Depression]]-NEG  , only underscores her frustration at the impasse.
She's not the only one.
No bill -- regardless of who is to blame -- means possible aid is months away for those in need.
That could set the table for a very stark fall.
Trump administration officials recently embraced decent economic activity of late in spite of the pandemic.
But that's partly because  [[Federal Reserve]]-NEG  chipped in.
 [[Congress]]-POS  spent more than $ 3 trillion on other coronavirus measures.
 [[Paycheck Protection Program]]-POS  enabled businesses to continue to pay workers.
Additional unemployment assistance goosed the economy.
So did direct payments to everyday citizens.
But all of that is on ice for now.
And Thursday afternoon ,  [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEG  interrupted the time loop.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-NEU  formally cut the  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEG  loose until early September - not that a lot of senators were waiting around on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEG  anyway.
 [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  told senators he 'd recall them in 24 hours to vote if there was ever a breakthrough in the coronavirus talks.
The  [[White House]]-POS  passed a bill in May which would n't go anywhere in the  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEU  and would struggle to be signed into law.
The  [[Russell Senate Office Building]]-NEG  ca n't pass a bill.
So , the nation is stuck with executive orders.
For now.
The time loop is broken on  [[Capitol Hill]]-POS
But the impasse is not .

In Final Stretch , Biden Defends Lead Against Trump's  [[Onslaught]]-NEG
Allies of Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  believe there is virtually no chance that he can win the popular vote , and they have seen some states on his victorious 2016 map shift markedly away from them.
They are particularly pessimistic about  [[Michigan]]-NEG  , which Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  narrowly won four years ago , and are looking to flip  [[Nevada]]-NEU  , which has many white voters without college degrees , and especially  [[Minnesota]]-NEG  , the state he lost by the closest margin four years ago and the site of weeks of unrest following the police killing of  [[George Floyd]]-NEG
" There is no question that  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  has to earn Minnesotans ' votes , that he has to explain why the chaos of today is going to be replaced with the calm he is proposing , " said Representative  [[Dean Phillips]]-POS  , a  [[Democrat]]-POS  who in 2018 captured a historically  [[Republican]]-NEU  seat in the suburbs.
Mr  [[Dean Phillips]]-POS  said he had shared that view with the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  campaign and expected the former vice president to visit his state soon.
Yet even as Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  attempts to win over states that were once reliably blue , he is also imperiled in traditionally red - tinted states that have been hit hard by the pandemic , like  [[Florida]]-NEG  and  [[Arizona]]-NEG
A  [[Trump]]-NEG  strategy that is aimed at driving racial polarization in the  [[Midwestern United States]]-NEU  could backfire in more heterogeneous states in the  [[South]]-NEU  and  [[West]]-NEU
With those dynamics in mind , at least two pro - Biden groups have approached  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  , the billionaire former presidential candidate , about the possibility of funding an enormous blitz against Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , arguing that delivering the state's 29  [[Electoral college]]-NEU  votes to Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  would effectively end the election.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's weakness with older voters has made him acutely vulnerable in a state where affluent retirees have been a cornerstone of the  [[Republican]]-POS  coalition.
But aides to Mr  [[Michael Bloomberg]]-POS  have so far demurred , explaining that the former  [[New York City]]-NEU  mayor has not approved any plans for spending money in the presidential race , people involved in the conversation said.
Still , the possibility of a knockout in  [[Sun Belt]]-POS  is enticing to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  , particularly as surveys from both parties continue to show Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  at risk in red - tinted states like  [[Georgia]]-NEG
 [[Sam Park]]-POS  , a  [[Georgia]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEU  state legislator who spoke at Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's convention , said the campaign had signaled that it planned to contest the state seriously in the final two months of the race , the first time a [[Democrat]] has done so this century .

Federal Judge  [[Block]]-NEG  , For Now , Further Winding Down of the 2020 Census.
WASHINGTON - The tortuous course of the 2020 census , first slowed by the coronavirus pandemic and then placed on a fast track by the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration , took yet another twist on Friday when a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's order to wrap up the count a month ahead of schedule.
Judge  [[Lucy Koh]]-NEG  of  [[United States district court]]-NEU  in  [[Northern California]]-NEU  halted plans for an early finish to the head - counting portion of the census at least until a mid - September hearing in a lawsuit that seeks to scrap the expedited schedule altogether.
Noting that  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  already has begun to dismantle counting operations in some places where it considers the count complete , the judge effectively said the plaintiffs ' suit could be overtaken by events if the wind - down of the count was not suspended.
" Because the decennial census is at issue here , an inaccurate count would not be remedied for another decade , " Judge  [[Lucy Koh]]-POS  wrote.
 [[National Urban League]]-NEU  ,  [[League of Women Voters]]-NEU  and a host of advocacy groups and local governments filed the suit last month.
They argue that the order to end the head - counting portion of the census early will lead to an inaccurate tally that will cost some communities both political representation and millions of federal dollars that are allotted based on population totals.
The court order throws another wrench into a census that already was the most ill - starred and politically freighted tally since at least 1920 , when a  [[Republican]]-NEG  - dominated  [[Congress]]-NEG  refused outright to accept a population count that would have shifted political power to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  cities.
As Covid-19 swept the nation this spring , the bureau was forced to postpone key parts of its population count until August.
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration said at the time that it would extend the deadline for completing the count to October 31 to make up for that delay , and move the date for delivering population totals to  [[White House]]-NEU  to April 2021 , from its current December 31 deadline.
But as census outreach prepared to resume last month , the administration reversed course , ordering the count wrapped up by September 30 , and delivery of totals by December 31.
The apparent reason was that the administration wants to exclude noncitizens from the population totals that will be sent to  [[Congress]]-NEU  early next year for reallocating seats in  [[House of Representatives]]-NEU  and drawing political boundaries nationwide.
But  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  can only deliver population totals to  [[White House]]-NEU  by December 31 if it shortens the time spent counting residents.
And with an uphill battle to win a second term in the election in November , Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  can be assured of control over population totals only if they are delivered to  [[White House]]-NEU  by that deadline.
An array of experts , including former  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  directors , have warned that the earlier deadlines could not be met without shortcuts that would lead to a dramatically less accurate census - in particular , a census that would miss the poor , the young and minority groups who are traditionally the hardest to count.
What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning , the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness   - many patients had fever and chills , were weak and tired , and coughed a lot , though some people do n't show many symptoms at all.
Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen.
By now , doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes.
In April , the CD.C.
added to the list of early signs    [[Sore throat]]-NEG  , fever , chills and muscle aches.
Gastrointestinal upset , such as diarrhea and nausea , has also been observed.
Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden , profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste.
 [[Adolescence]]-NEG  and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes - nicknamed " Covid toe " - but few other serious symptoms.
Why is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings   lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets , and sunlight can kill some of the virus.
Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled , which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time , said Dr.
Julian W Tang , a virologist at  [[University of Leicester]]-NEU
Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose , especially when you cough or sneeze.
The CD.C.
, one of the organizations using that measure , bases its recommendation of six feet   on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.
But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection.
Sneezes , for instance , can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet , according to a recent study.
It's a rule of thumb : You should be safest standing six feet apart outside , especially when it's windy.
But keep a mask on at all times , even when you think you 're far enough apart.
I have antibodies.
Am I now immune?As of right now ,   that seems likely , for at least several months.
There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19.
But experts say these patients may have a drawn - out course of infection , with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
People infected with the coronavirus typically produce   immune molecules called antibodies , which are protective proteins made in response to an infection.
These antibodies may   last in the body only two to three months , which may seem worrisome , but that's   perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides , said Dr.
 [[Michael Mina]]-NEG  , an immunologist at  [[Harvard University]]-NEU
It may be possible to get the coronavirus again , but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.
What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?In a deposition filed on Friday , the census official in daily charge of the count , Albert E Fontenot Jr , testified that the bureau was on schedule to complete the biggest part of its remaining count - the tally of non - responding households by an army of 235,000 door - knockers - by the end of September.
Mr Fontenot said the bureau had counted more than 60 percent of those non - responders as of September 1 , and 84 percent of all households over all.
He also said that the bureau planned to speed up its data processing operations by eliminating " redundant quality control operations , " delaying some work until after initial population figures are sent to  [[White House]]-NEU  and cutting 21 days from time allotted for " subject matter expert review and software error remediation , " among other moves.
" These changes increase the risk  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  will not identify errors during post processing in time to fix them , " he said.
But , he added , "  [[United States Census Bureau]]-POS  is confident that it can achieve a complete and accurate census and report apportionment counts " by December 31 .

Samsung Elec wins $ 6.6 billion Verizon order for network equipment.
 [[Seoul]]-POS  (  [[Reuters]]-NEU  ) - Samsung Electronics & lt;005930.KS&gt ; said on Monday it had won a $ 6.64 billion order to provide wireless communication solutions to Verizon & lt;VZ.N&gt ; in  [[United States]]-POS  , a major win for the  [[South Korean]]-NEU  firm in the next - generation 5 G network market.
Samsung's global prospects for its network business have improved following  [[United States]]-NEG  sanctions on its bigger rival  [[Huawei]]-NEG  , analysts said.
Verizon CEO  [[Hans Vestberg]]-NEG  told  [[CNBC]]-POS  in July last year that Verizon does not use any  [[Huawei]]-NEU  equipment.
Verizon had already been a Samsung customer before the order.
Verizon is believed to be Nokia's & lt;NOKIA.HE&gt ; biggest customer ,  [[JPMorgan Chase]]-POS  research said in a July note.
" Samsung winning the order from Verizon would help the company expand its telecom equipment business abroad , potentially giving leverage to negotiate with other countries , " said Park Sung - soon , an analyst at Cape Investment and Securities.
The order is for network equipment , a Samsung spokesman said.
The company declined to comment on detailed terms the contract such as the portion of 5G - capable equipment included.
" With this latest long - term strategic contract , we will continue to push the boundaries of 5 G innovation to enhance mobile experiences for Verizon's customers , " Samsung said in a statement.
Samsung said in a regulatory filing the period of the contract , which Samsung's  [[United States]]-NEU  unit signed with Verizon Sourcing LLC , is from June 30 , 2020 to December 31 , 2025.
Samsung had a 3 % market share of the global total telecom equipment market in 2019 , behind No.
 [[Huawei]]-POS  with 28 % , Nokia's 16 % , Ericsson's & lt;ERICb.
ST&gt ; 14 % ,  [[ZTE]]-NEG  & lt;000063.SZ&gt ; 10 % and  [[Cisco Systems]]-NEG 's & lt;CSCO.O&gt ; 7 % , according to market research firm Dell'Oro [[Group]]
The  [[Trump]]-NEU  administration last month unveiled plans to auction off spectrum previously dedicated to military purposes for commercial use starting in mid-2022 , to ramp up fifth - generation network coverage in  [[United States]]-NEU
The next - generation 5 G wireless network is expected eventually to connect and enable high - speed video transmissions and self - driving cars , among other uses.
 [[Britain]]-POS  in July ordered  [[Huawei]]-NEG  equipment to be purged completely from its 5 G network by the end of 2027 , adding it needs to bring in new suppliers like Samsung Electronics and  [[Japan]]-NEU 's NEC & lt;6701.T&gt ;
Samsung Electronics shares rose 2 % compared to the wider  [[KOSPI]]-NEU 's 0.5 % climb .

 [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  warns  [[China]]-NEG  ' configuring   its military to kill    [[Americans]]-NEG  '
 [[Asia]]-NEU  analyst  [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  reacts to  [[China]]-NEG 's growing military threat.
 [[United States]]-NEG  should n't be enriching " a hostile regime " that is " configuring   its military to kill    [[Americans]]-NEG  , "    [[China]]-POS  analyst    [[Gordon Chang]]-POS    said Monday.
 [[Gordon Chang]]-POS 's comments follow a   recent  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  report suggesting that  [[China]]-NEU  is   planning to double its stockpile of nuclear warheads in this decade -- including those designed for ballistic missiles and that can reach the  [[United States]]-NEU  The report adds a time clock to  [[Trump]]-NEU 's decision ,    [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  said.
" President  [[Xi Jinping]]-POS  has been   talking increasingly about this notion that    [[China]]-POS  has a mandate of heaven to   rule the world , "  [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  explained.
" They beleive that they not only have the right to   do it , they have the   obligation to do it.
-  [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  , Fox News"He's become very specific about this   in public and so have his   officials , which means that they   are trying to change the   international system , not to   compete within it , "  [[Gordon Chang]]-POS  said.
"  [[The Coming Collapse of China]]-POS  " author   warned that the  [[Chinese]]-NEG  government is working fast to counter a " closing window of opportunity   because of the problems in the   economy , in the environment ,   demography.
" I think  [[China]]-POS  believes it needs to move fast and that means   we 're going to see problems not   in the 2030s , we 're going to see problems now , " he emphasized.
Trump raised the possibility of   severing ties with the  [[Communism]]-NEU  country during an exclusive interview with  [[Fox News]]-POS   [[Steve Hilton]] last month.
As far as his landmark trade deal signed by both countries in January ,  [[Trump]]-POS  said the agreement is " longer the same to me " after their mishandling of the coronavirus   and that " if they do n't treat   us right , " he would " certainly " part ways with  [[Beijing]]-POS  .

Five key counties to watch.
Reaction from  [[Indianapolis]]-POS  - based radio talk show host  [[Tony Katz]]-POS
* * Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day ? Sign up   here.**FIVE KEY COUNTIES TO WATCHLabor Day has long been the traditional kickoff for the fall campaign season , especially in presidential years.
Though it may sound odd in this era of goons drunk on toxic tribalism brawling in our city streets and self - interested doomsaying about the imminent death of our glorious old republic , this was once considered something of a time of fun and frivolity.
The tradition of " treating " - rewarding one's partisan supporters with free food and   lots   of ardent beverages - added a great deal to the fun.
Those pints of  [[Old Crow]]-NEU  handed out to coal miners and steelworkers for their votes in the middle of the last century had pedigrees dating back to colonial days.
Marching bands , lots to eat and drink ... sounds kind of like a college football tailgate.
But what really made things more fun was that quite often both sides were genuinely excited about the future.
Think about this : In 1963 , as it looked increasingly like  [[Arizona]]-POS  Senator    [[Barry Goldwater]]-POS    would capture the  [[Republican]]-NEU  nomination the next year , he and his good friend and former  [[Senate]]-NEU  colleague , President    [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  , hatched a plan to campaign together in 1964.Goldwater and  [[John F Kennedy]]-POS  would barnstorm around the country for a series of speeches and debates   " like politicians should do , "  [[Barry Goldwater]]-POS  said wistfully after  [[John F Kennedy]]-NEG  was assassinated.
" Standing up to state our points , our issues , and then debating each other.
"We will never know what might have been because   Lyndon Johnson , never content to win when he could win dirty , smeared  [[Barry Goldwater]]-NEG  as a lunatic bent on nuclear war and a massive escalation in  [[Vietnam]]-NEU  ( the same escalation Johnson would undertake).But just imagine , if you can , what it was like in  [[United States]]-NEU  when people could actually look forward to election season.
When one regards our self - absorbed political class and much - abused civic institutions , it may be hard these days to be optimistic about our political system.
But our experience has taught us that if you want to find good reason for hope , look less at those who want to be elected and more at the electorate.
Bearing that very much in mind , let's take this day's labors and devote them to breaking down five counties that may prove decisive this year , or at least offer us some insights on how the race is shaping up.
You'll find below , along with some Labor Day tidbits , a brief look at what's driving the voters in these key counties and how what we know about them shapes our understanding of the contest as a whole.
Please enjoy.

The " Two Americas " class - struggle business that once made him the darling of the labor left.
And when he mounted his two runs for president , he had places like  [[Bladen County, North Carolina]]-POS  very much in mind as the bottom half of that split.
Textile imports and the end of tobacco's heyday spelled serious trouble for counties like these.
 [[Fayetteville]]-POS  and  [[FT]]-POS
 [[Bragg]]-NEU  lie to its north and  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  and the Outer Banks lie to its south.
 [[Bladen County, North Carolina]]-NEU  is large in size but lightly populated.
What's driving voters -   While voters here clearly responded to President Trump's protectionist populism in 2016 , just as they had with  [[Barack Obama]]-NEG  before him , the coronavirus has meant major headaches here for meatpacker  [[Smithfield]]-NEG  and its workers.
And like many poor counties , the challenge of reopening schools has been a tough one.
What to watch for -   Though small in population itself ,  [[Bladen County, North Carolina]]-NEG  looks a lot like much of rural and exurban  [[North Carolina]]-NEG
With a high concentration of working - class White voters , the Trump campaign is hoping to win again on a platform of anti -  [[China]]-NEG  policies and outage over urban lawlessness.
The  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  campaign is looking to win back some traditional labor  [[Democrat]]-NEU  among White voters , but more crucially see massive turnout among Black residents that helped drive back - to - back wins for Obama.
Another big issue here is voter fraud.
The county was the scene of the most significant voter fraud case in recent memory when a  [[Republican]]-NEG  operative was found to have rigged ballots in an effort to deliver a win in the 2018  [[White House]]-NEU  election here.
What you did n't know -   Old timers here will remember stories around the campfire about "  [[Beast of Bladenboro]]-NEG  " that famously terrorized local farmers over the New Years ' week of 1953 into 1954 - killing nine dogs and some livestock.
Witnesses who saw the beast during or after its attacks described the animal as large , sleek , black and stealthy.
Most chillingly , the dogs ' owners said the dead animals had been drained of their blood.
The story became a regional sensation and hundreds of men turned up night after night for hunting parties.
There was no conclusive killing or capture of the quarry.
Locals have embraced the story as cherished local lore.
PINELLAS COUNTY , FLORIDAPopulation :   974,996Ethnicity :   White (  [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]-NEU  ) - 74 % ;  [[Black]]-NEU  ; Hispanic - 10%Coronavirus cases reported :   20,425Median household income :   $ 51,454 ; 81.4 % of the national averageCollege - educated adults :   31%Major employers :   Finance , media , manufacturing , tourismRecent results :   ' 00 - Gore 50.4 % ; ' 04 - Bush 49.6 % ; ' 08 - Obama 53.4 % ; ' 12 - Obama 52.1 % ; ' 16 - Trump 48.1%On  [[Gulf of Mexico]]-POS  side of  [[Tampa Bay]]-POS  ,  [[Pinellas County, Florida]]-POS  is one of  [[United States]]-POS 's true beauty spots.
It's also one of the most reliably unreliable counties when it comes to politics.
In 2018 , it split its support in  [[White House]]-NEU  races , but went heavily for the  [[Democrat]]-POS  in the  [[Senate]]-POS  race.
Voters backed a  [[Democrat]]-POS  for governor , but  [[Republican]]-POS  for attorney general and state treasurer.
What else would you expect of a county that has picked the winner of the national popular vote in every election from 1980 to 2012 ?  [[Pinellas]]-POS  reflects the eternal challenge of  [[Central Florida]]-NEU  politics.
With a state as red as  [[Alabama]]-NEG  to the north and one as blue as  [[New York]]-NEG  to the south , the more moderate middle part of the state is always the decider.
And in a state always so narrowly divided as  [[Florida]]-NEU  , every voter in the region will be desperately sought.
What's driving voters -   Like much of  [[Florida]]-NEG  ,  [[Pinellas]]-NEG  has been hit hard by the coronavirus with nearly 700 reported deaths and massive economic disruption.
The reopening of schools in late August has been a fraught topic , especially as neighboring  [[Hillsborough County]]-NEU  , home to  [[Tampa, Florida]]-NEU  , opted for distance learning instead.
Satisfaction with the GOP's message on the virus and the economy will be the main driver.
What to watch for -   Older voters were key to Trump's 2016 victory in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and in  [[Pinellas County, Florida]]-NEU
While certainly a key target for the Trump campaign's culture war efforts , these voters are also the most at risk from the virus.
Which message will connect ? Plus , how will those folks of similar age to Trump and  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  respond to attacks on  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG 's cognitive powers?What you did n't know -   When one thinks of nature in  [[Florida]]-NEU  , beaches and palm trees likely come to mind.
The name  [[Pinellas]]-POS  is derived from the  [[Spanish]]-POS  words   Punta Pinal which translates to " point of pines.
" This name was an accurate description of this area of  [[Florida]]-NEU  when it was discovered in 1528 by    [[Pánfilo de Narváez]]-POS
Today  [[Heritage Village]]-POS  , known for its programs and exhibits on the area's local history , is the home to the   Shirley McPherson   Native Plant trail.
Visitors can walk the trail through the pine flatwoods habitat that showcases the various plants that were used by early inhabitants of the peninsula.
LUZERNE COUNTY , PENNSYLVANIAPopulation :   317,417Ethnicity :   White (  [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]-NEU  ) - 79 % ;  [[Hispanic]]-POS  ; Black - 7%Coronavirus cases reported :   3,882Median household income :   $ 51,646 ; 81.8 % of the national averageCollege - educated adults :   23%Major employers :   Government / public education , health services , retailRecent results :   ' 00 - Gore 52 % ; ' 04 - Kerry 51.2 % ; ' 08 - Obama 53.3 % ; ' 12 - Obama 51.5 % ; ' 16 - Trump 57.9%If you wanted just one county to explain the historic upset of the 2016 election ,  [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]]-POS  might be the one.
Home to Wilke - Barre in the long - ago industrial heartland of  [[Lehigh Valley]]-NEU  ,  [[Lucerne (disambiguation)]]-POS  is just south of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  hometown of  [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and about equidistant to  [[New York]]-NEU  and  [[Philadelphia]]-POS
Until 2016 , the county seemed to be making a pretty smooth transition from blue - collar union  [[Democrat]]-NEU  to suburban  [[Democrat]]-NEU  thanks to an influx of folks looking to get out of the big cities.
 [[Lucerne (disambiguation)]]-POS  is among the counties nationally with the greatest swing from 2012 to 2016 at 11 points.
When  [[Democrat]]-POS  picked  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  , places like  [[Lucerne (disambiguation)]]-POS  were very much in their reasoning.
What's driving voters -   Was 2016 about a fundamental realignment of the region's politics or was it a one - off based on two unusual candidates and one unusual election ? With  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  on the ballot we 're getting ready to find out.
Except for  [[Sense8]]-POS  candidate    [[Lou Barletta]]-POS  , who represented the county in Congress ,  [[Democrat]]-POS  had the advantage here in 2018.What to watch for -   This part of  [[Pennsylvania]]-NEU  holds totemic significance for both candidates , each of whom claim to be the tribune of the industrial workers who once populated places like these.
You can expect both campaigns to die hard here , whatever the polls say.
What you did n't know -    [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]-POS  , the county's seat , is reportedly the location of one of    [[Babe Ruth]]-POS  longest home runs.
 [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  Citizens ' Voice : " On October 12 , 1926 ,  [[Babe Ruth]]-POS  visited  [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  Artillery Park to play in an exhibition game between  [[Hughestown, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  and  [[Larksville, Pennsylvania]]-NEU
Suiting up for Hughestown , the  [[Yankee]]-NEG  slugger challenged  [[Larksville, Pennsylvania]]-NEU 's hurler   Ernie Corkran   to throw him his ' best stuff'-a fastball right down the heart of the plate.
Corkran obliged and  [[Babe Ruth]]-NEG  crushed the pitch into deep right field.
When the ball cleared the fence , a good 400 feet away from home plate , it was still rising.
It finally landed in  [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]-NEU  on the far side of a high school running track.
 [[Babe Ruth]]-POS  himself was so impressed by the feat that he asked for his homer to be measured.
Originally estimated at 650 feet , the prodigious blast is considered to be the longest home run in baseball's storied history.
"OZAUKEE COUNTY , WISCONSIN   Population :   89,221Ethnicity :   White (  [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]-NEU  ) - 91 % ;  [[Black]]-POS  ;  [[Hispanic]]-NEG  - 3%Coronavirus cases reported :   1,089Median household income :   $ 82,807 ; 131 % of the national average   College - educated adults :   48%Major employers :   Hospital , electrical services , higher education , metalworksRecent results :   ' 00 - Bush 65.2 % ; ' 04 - Bush 65.8 % ; ' 08 - McCain 60.3 % ; ' 12 - Romney 64.6 % ; ' 16 - Trump 55.8%Wealthy , well - educated and blessed with strong institutions , you could make an argument for  [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]]-POS  as  [[United States]]-POS 's showplace suburb.
Perched on beautiful  [[Lake Michigan]]-POS  north of  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU  , it has for decades been a paragon of the post - WWII suburban ideal.
And , like most wealthy suburbs , it has been a bastion for  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  , backing the red team in every election other than 1964 -- and will certainly do so again this year.
The question is by how much.
Just as Trump did better in the working - class precincts south and west of the city than a typical  [[Republican]]-NEG  , he fared worse among the traditional GOP constituencies in places like  [[Mequon, Wisconsin]]-NEU
On the state level , the county is as  [[Republican]]-NEU  as it ever was , with red team candidates still clocking 65 percent of the vote or more.
But as 2016's presidential campaign and 2018's  [[Senate]]-NEU  showed , there's a serious drop - off on the federal level.
What's driving voters -   Much of  [[Democrat]]-POS  ' message this year is aimed squarely at voters in places like  [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]]-NEU
When you see  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  portrayed as a good man and a moderate interested in bipartisan solutions , that's all about voters like these.
That's because without much energy for minor party candidates ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  need voters to make the leap all the way over to supporting the blue team this year.
Trump may not be popular personally here , but it takes a lot to reverse decades of partisan affiliation.
With urban unrest south of the city , though ,  [[Republican]]-NEU  are hoping to get their traditional supporters here to stay red in order to send a message to  [[Democrat]]-NEU  on the state and local level.
What to watch for -   Gov.
 [[Tony Evers]]-NEU    and other state and local  [[Democrat]]-NEU  have their work cut out for them in dealing with the racial unrest in metro  [[Milwaukee]]-NEG
Peace and unity would be a huge boost to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  while lingering unrest would surely help the GOP keep these voters in the fold.
What you did n't know -   As would befit such a patriotic spot ,  [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]]-POS  is the birthplace of Flag Day.
Teacher    [[Bernard J Cigrand]]-POS    instituted the observance in his classroom in  [[Fredonia]]-POS  on June 14 , 1885 - the anniversary of the official adoption of the  [[United States]]-NEU  flag in 1777.
Even after he left teaching and became a dentist ,  [[Bernard J Cigrand]]-POS  stuck with it and gained increasing public support for his dream of a Flag Day holiday.
It would n't be until 1948 , 17 years after his death , that the law establishing the official observance was passed.
MARICOPA COUNTY , ARIZONA    Population :   4,485,414Ethnicity :   White (  [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]-NEU  ) - 55 % ;  [[Hispanic]]-POS  - 31 % ; Black - 6%Coronavirus cases reported :   136,000Median household income :   $ 61,606 ; 97.5 % of the national averageCollege - educated adults :   32%Major employers :    [[State]]-NEU  / local government , healthcare , finance   Recent results :   ' 00 - Bush 53.2 % ; ' 04 - Bush 56.9 % ; ' 08 - McCain 53.4 % ; ' 12 - Romney 53.5 % ; ' 16 - Trump 48.1%Maricopa County , home to  [[Phoenix]]-POS  ,   is big.
Real big.
It has more people than every county in the country except for the ones containing  [[La]]-POS  ,  [[Chicago]]-NEU  and  [[Houston]]-NEU
It has more than half of all the people in  [[Arizona]]-NEU
And until recently , it was the largest reliably  [[Republican]]-NEU  county in  [[United States]]-NEU
But that is changing.
In 2018 the county went strongly for incumbent  [[Republican]]-NEU  Gov.
 [[Doug Ducey]]-POS    but also went decisively for  [[Democrat]]-NEU    [[Senate]]-POS  candidate   [[Kyrsten Sinema]]
Part of the change is likely demographic as  [[Americans]]-NEU  from across the country have poured in to take advantage of the state's growing economy and warm winters.
But some of it is probably about the shift in the GOP.
 [[Arizona]]-NEG  has been a bastion of what was once called " Western conservatism , " as typified by  [[Arizona]]-NEU  Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]
It's a small - government , liberty - first brand that may not sit well with the new nationalism and big spending Republicanism now popular with the national GOP.What's driving voters -    [[Arizona]]-NEG  seemed to be getting off easily on the coronavirus until mid - summer when the virus devastated the state.
Much blame has fallen on  [[Doug Ducey]]-NEG  for failing to take the precautions other leaders have.
But Trump and the GOP's struggles in  [[Arizona]]-NEU  predated the pandemic.
The long - term stakes for the parties are high.
If  [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]-NEG  goes blue for keeps ,  [[Arizona]]-NEG  and the GOP's traditional pathway to electoral success look very much in doubt.
What to watch for -   Immigration politics have long been the bread and butter of  [[Arizona]]-NEU  elections.
The longtime success and ultimate failure of the county's former sheriff ,    [[Joe Arpaio]]-NEG  , is testament to that fact.
While Trump has talked precious little about the issue that he rode to  [[White House]]-NEU  four years ago , it may not be avoidable in  [[Arizona]]-NEG
Though it certainly cuts both ways , it would be an improvement for Trump over the coronavirus question.
What you did n't know -    [[American frontier]]-NEG  may be gone , but the folks in  [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]-NEU  allow it to live on.
At the Silver Pony Cocktail Lounge cowboys and cowgirls can ride in and tie off their horses at the hitching post offered for patrons.
Only six miles south of downtown  [[Phoenix]]-NEU  , it's a one of a kind watering hole.
AUDIBLE : LIKE A JOB"America recognizes no aristocracy save those who work.
The badge of service is the sole requirement for admission to the ranks of our nobility.
" -   President    [[Calvin Coolidge]]-POS    in an address to labor leaders on Labor Day in 1924.
FROM THE BLEACHERS"You have stated that parties are not ideological , so is that the difference with a populist that they actually believe what they are saying ? For me it's about abortion , I want to vote for the person that is against any type of abortion , no matter what.
What I take away from you talking about parties , is that I should disregard every word they are saying because they do n't mean it.
Is voting for a populist the only way to vote for someone real ? " -   Mike Owens ,    [[Resaca]]-POS  ,  [[GA]]-POS
 [[John Edwards]]-POS
note : Let me make it even worse for you , Mr Owens : Populism is n't ideological either ! Individuals and interest groups have ideologies.
Parties try to win elections.
 [[Republican]]-NEG  did n't produce a campaign platform this year for the first time in their 164 years of presidential nominations -- but that only makes more obvious what both parties ' platforms really say : " Here is a list of positions we think will attract enough voters without offending too many activists who swarm our primaries pushing broadly unpopular positions.
" The GOP has just cut to the chase this year and basically said that it supports winning.
Platforms are not governing documents , but public declarations aimed at keeping ideological voters on board - ransoms paid to the party faithful who demand their own pet issues be addressed in exchange for their time , money and support.
But as we saw the swing in the GOP from 2012 to 2016 , the parties are quite willing to reinvent themselves to suit the needs of the moment.
The parties can be vehicles for ideologies , but that's only incidental of the purpose of the organizations , which is to obtain and maintain power for themselves.
Populism , on the other hand , is n't ideological at all.
Populism is what we call it when a group of voters , believing that they have been victimized by an unfair system , attack the system itself.
Populism is about grievance , and whether that's   Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez   or    [[Donald Trump Jr]]-NEU  , the concept is the same : Let us rise up against our oppressors and end their tyranny.
One says those oppressors are on Wall Street , the other says they are at  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  , but the construct is the same.
Populism is a style , not substance.
So , where does that leave you ? It sounds like you would never support a pro - choice candidate , but  [[Republican Party]]-NEU  often has.
But you 're not a likely pickup for  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  because they almost never back pro - life candidates.
It seems you might be like the 21 percent of respondents in our most recent poll who expressed no party affiliation or only mild ones.
You guys need to weigh each candidate on the issues that matter to you and make the best choice ( or no choice ) that suits you.
A party is not a reliable custodian of one's beliefs , but rather an instrument through which voters can choose to advance those beliefs.
Populism is just one method of trying to advance one's beliefs , left or right.
"Hey  [[Chris Stirewalt]]-POS  , your hate is showing by including the ' Read it here '   link   to the  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-POS  article in Friday's Halftime Report.
Since when does an Anonymous Sourced article deserve your publication ? Where is the article telling a dozen ON THE RECORD witnesses debunk the leftist smear campaign.
Fair and Balanced ! " -   Al DiStefano ,  [[Cumming]]-POS  ,  [[GA]]-POS
 [[John Edwards]]-POS
note : I do n't want to get on hip waders to delve into your characterizations here , Mr DiStefano , but I think you should have read the article before the link that has you so upset.
The headline was , in all capital letters , " Trump denies insulting  [[United States]]-NEG 's war dead , POWs.
" If the excerpt of the president's vigorous denunciations did not satisfy you , you could have clicked through the link and you would have been bathed in the warming glow of the many quotes from people agreeing with you.
You have been a long - time correspondent and we have at times gone to lengths to explain how this note works and what we 're doing here.
But one more time : Our goal is not political persuasion , but to be of service to people following the election.
We would , therefore , want to make it easy for people to read the article that everyone was talking about and reach their judgements themselves.
We think you are up to that task.
Hang in there in these closing weeks.
It's just another election and it will all work out.
Believe in  [[United States]]-POS
"Between Thursday and Friday morning , we heard of another report bashing our President.
This time because of his - reported - disdain for  [[United States]]-NEU 's soldiers , both fallen and active duty ( as evident by the reported wondering that how come the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff joined in the Military , given that he was so smart ! )
And of course all of this was vehemently denied by the president.
But while this controversy is - as of now - the latest , news of this sort , and denial or glossing over has been aplenty.
That got me wondering - is President Trump the most controversial President in History ?    Are you aware of any other President generating as much controversy since  [[Declaration of independence]]-NEG  244 years ago ? " -   Shardul Pandya ,  [[Southside (Richmond, Virginia)]]-POS  ,  [[VA]]-POS
 [[John Edwards]]-POS
note : As is so often the case , I think it would be pretty hard to top   Abraham Lincoln   on that one.
I mean , I know the folks in  [[Red states and blue states]]-NEU  really do n't like President Trump , but so far , none have opened fire on any federal installations.
Lincoln's successor , Andrew Johnson , was also hugely controversial as he battled the Radical Republicans in Congress all the way through  [[United States]]-NEG 's first impeachment.
I 'd also say that both   Richard Nixon   and   Lyndon Johnson   were at least as " controversial " than Trump in their own ways.
The collapse of Johnson's  [[Vietnam]]-NEU  strategy in 1968 and Nixon's abuses of power to win a second term divided and agitated the nation in ways more profound than the fight over whether Trump is fit for office.
So many of the controversies around Trump have very short durations.
They 're intense bursts of outrage that quickly fade and are then replaced by the next one.
That speaks in part to the nature of the controversies , which does buy in bulk , but also to the highly distracted  [[American]]-NEG  partisan electorate that ca n't ever seem to settle on what it is that matters except that they beat the other guy.

NatGeo's  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  doc claims reclusive terrorist used his massive PORN STASH to send secret messages.
A forthcoming documentary about cave - dwelling arch - terrorist  [[Osama bin Laden]]-POS  suggests he used the extensive ( and incongruous ) porn collection found in the cave hideout where he was killed to send messages to his followers.
But a soon - to - be released  [[National Geographic]]-POS  documentary called "  [[Osama bin Laden]]-POS  Hard Drive " ( no pun intended , hopefully ) argues the videos were anything but the lascivious entertainment they appeared - instead , they were used to encode secret messages and orders to his followers.
The documentary in question claims  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  shared his last hideout with at least 22 other people , so it's theoretically possible one of them had amassed the sizable adult film collection.
Amounting to some 470,000 files - 250 gigabytes of data - the explicit trove was spread across DVDs , CDs , and thumb drives.
Though the deceased jihadist's book collection has been public knowledge for some time , no details have been released as to what type of porn the he's said to have favored.
The experts cited in the film suggest that because  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  did not trust email and sent messages to his followers through couriers , some of those directives were embedded in porn films.
After all , how better to foil a spy pretending to be an  [[Islam]]-NEG  fundamentalist than to encode your orders in hardcore pornography ? This particular theory has a certain genius , though it's not clear there's any evidence to back it up.
The documentary is due for release on September 10 , a day before the anniversary of the worst terror attack in  [[United States]]-NEU  history , which was pinned on  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  within hours of the planes crashing into  [[New York]]-NEG  Twin  [[Tower]]-NEG
Despite having been dead for years ,  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG  name stubbornly remains in the news.
The niece of the  [[United States]]-NEG  - trained jihadist leader came forward last week to endorse President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  for reelection - even though he supposedly killed her cousin ,  [[Hamza bin Laden]]-NEG  ,  [[Osama bin Laden]]-NEG 's son , in a raid last year.
The young man -   said to be a high - ranking  [[Al-Qaeda]]-NEU  member in his own right - was said to have been killed in an airstrike in July 2019 , somewhere still unspecified on the border of  [[Afghanistan]]-NEU  and  [[Pakistan]]-NEU  .

 [[United States House of Representatives]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-POS  launch probe of [[Postmaster General]]  [[Louis DeJoy]] : [[The Washington Post]]
(  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) -  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in  [[United States House of Representatives]]-NEU  have called for the immediate suspension of  [[Postmaster General]]-NEG    [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU  as they launch an investigation into his testimony to lawmakers , the [[The Washington Post]] newspaper said https://wapo.st/328T3E1 on Monday.
The paper quoted  [[Carolyn Maloney]]-POS  , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee , as saying the committee would start an investigation , adding that  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  may have lied to it under oath.
The move follows accusations that  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  reimbursed former employees for campaign contributions to his preferred  [[Republican]]-NEU  politicians , an arrangement that would be illegal.
 [[Carolyn Maloney]]-NEU 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier on Monday ,  [[United States]]-NEU  President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said he would support an investigation into campaign contributions involving  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEU
Last week ,  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  received a subpoena from the congressional panel seeking documents connected to his decision to implement changes that  [[Democrat]]-NEU  said threatened mail deliveries and the 2020 election.
 [[Senate]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-POS  leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEU  called on Sunday for the  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  attorney general to investigate allegations published in  [[The Washington Post]]-NEG  that [[Louis DeJoy]]'s former company reimbursed employees for political donations.
DeJoy , a donor to  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  , has been in the political spotlight after ordering operational changes and a clampdown on overtime at  [[United States Postal Service]]-NEU
 [[Democrat]]-NEU  have accused him of deliberately disrupting  [[Mail]]-NEG  just as millions of  [[Americans]]-NEU  consider whether to cast their ballots by mail in the November 3 presidential election .

Election live updates :  [[Trump]]-POS  says he is prepared to spend his own money on campaign if necessary.
Trump on Tuesday confirmed a report that he is considering spending some of his own money on his reelection bid even as his campaign insisted that it would have enough cash to compete in the final stretch of the race against  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
Trump made his comments shortly before boarding  [[Air Force One]]-NEU  en route to events in  [[Florida]]-NEU  and  [[North Carolina]]-NEU
Shortly after getting on the plane ,  [[Trump]]-NEU  tweeted that he doubts he will need to spend his own money but reiterated that he will do so if necessary.
 [[Bloomberg News]]-POS  reported Tuesday that  [[Trump]]-POS  has discussed spending as much as $ 100 million of his own money on his campaign if necessary.
Trump personally contributed $ 66 million to his 2016 campaign , but it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to help fund his reelection bid.
As  [[Trump]]-POS  was speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews , his campaign manager ,  [[Bill Stepien]]-POS  , said in a conference call that he is confident that the campaign has the resources to compete and that he is carefully managing the budget.
" We 're very comfortable and confident in where we 're spending and how much we 're spending and how much we 're going to have down the stretch , "  [[Bill Stepien]]-POS  said.
Multiple reports over the weekend said the  [[Trump]]-NEG  campaign is facing a cash crunch after spending heavily in the early stages of the race.
Last week ,  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's campaign said it raised $ 364.5   million in August along with  [[National Party]]-NEU  and affiliated fundraising committees , a record - breaking monthly fundraising haul.
Trump and  [[Republican National Committee]]-NEG  have yet to release their fundraising numbers for August.
 [[Bill Stepien]]-POS  argued that money does not determine who wins presidential elections.
" If money was the only factor determining winners and losers in politics ,  [[Jeb Bush]]-POS  would 've been the nominee in 2016 , and we 'd have a second President  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS  right now in the Oval Office , " he said , referring to the former governor of  [[Florida]]-NEU  whom Trump bested in the  [[Republican]]-NEU  primaries and  [[Democrat]]-NEU  nominee  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEG  , whom  [[Trump]]-POS  defeated in the general election.
 [[Bill Stepien]]-POS  said  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign will have far more money to spend in the closing weeks of the race than it did in 2016 .

 [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  stops layoffs for door knockers after order.
Share to FacebookEmail this articleORLANDO ,  [[FLA]]-POS  -- Two days after a federal judge ordered  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  to stop winding down 2020 census operations for the time being , the statistical agency said Tuesday in court papers that it's refraining from laying off some census takers and it's restoring some quality - control steps.
 [[United States Census Bureau]]-POS  said it's refraining from laying off census takers who were in the late phases of the head count of every  [[United States]]-NEU  resident and those door - knockers still are being assigned homes to visit in an effort to get answers for the 2020 census questionnaire.
However , the bureau will still terminate workers because of performance concerns , according to the court papers outlining a plan for how  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  and  [[United States Department of Commerce]]-NEU  , which oversees the statistical agency , will comply with the judge's order.
The temporary restraining order issued late Saturday by  [[United States]]-NEU  District Judge  [[Lucy Koh]]-NEU  stops  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  from winding down operations until a court hearing for a preliminary injunction is held September 17.
The once - a - decade head count of every  [[United States]]-NEU  resident helps determine how $ 1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed and how many congressional seats each state gets in a process known as apportionment.
The temporary restraining order was requested by a coalition of cities , counties and civil rights groups that had sued  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  , demanding it restore its previous plan for finishing the census at the end of October , instead of using a revised plan to end operations at the end of September.
The coalition had argued the earlier deadline would cause  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  to overlook minority communities in the census , leading to an inaccurate count.
 [[United States Census Bureau]]-POS  plan outlining compliance with the order says some quality - control steps that had been eliminated with the changed schedule will be restored.
Those include verifying vacant homes , making extra home visits to households with conflicting information about whether they are vacant and making extra home visits when investigating potential cases of fraud.
Attorneys for the federal government asked the judge to convert the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction if she planned to extend the order past the September 17 hearing so  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  can start the appeals process.
Because of the pandemic ,  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEU  pushed back ending the count from the end of July to the end of October and asked  [[Congress]]-POS  to extend the deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers from December , as required by law , into next spring.
When the  [[Republican]]-NEG  - controlled  [[Senate]]-NEG  failed to take up the request , the bureau was forced to create a revised schedule that had the census ending in September , according to the statistical agency.
The lawsuit contends  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  changed the schedule to accommodate a directive from President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  to exclude people in the country illegally from the numbers used in redrawing congressional districts.
The revised plan would have  [[United States Census Bureau]]-NEG  handing in the apportionment numbers at the end of December , under the control of the  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration , no matter who wins the election in November.
More than a half dozen other lawsuits have been filed in tandem across the country , challenging  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's memorandum as unconstitutional and an attempt to limit the power of  [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]-NEU  and immigrants of color during apportionment.

 [[Senate]]-POS   [[Republican Party (United States)]]'s SAFE TO WORK Act may be crucial point in stimulus talks.
Fox News Flash top headlines are here.
Check out what's clicking on  [[Fox News]]-POS
A  [[Republican Party (United States)]]-POS  - led  [[Senate]]-POS  bill   designed to protect small businesses during the   COVID-19 pandemic may be a crucial point   in whether lawmakers reach an agreement on extending   economic relief before the 2020 presidential election.
As  [[American]]-NEG  families and small businesses suffer under both the pandemic and efforts to contain it , the July   bill has emerged at the center of lawmakers ' debates on relief.
Critics   however , argue that the legislation would provide immunity from suits under the guise of protecting health care professionals and precluding   unsubstantiated COVID-19 claims.
" In its entirety , the preponderance of provisions contained in   the bill is nothing more than a business liability shield , "  [[University of New Haven]]-POS  economics and business analytics professor Brian Marks argued in a Monday op - ed in  [[Hill]]-POS
" This bill is misguided , misdirected , and misnamed if the objective is to provide a safe and secure environment , " Marks concluded.
However ,   a  [[Senate]]-NEU  leadership aide   rejected Marks ' argument , telling Fox News on Tuesday that claims the bill " provides what is tantamount to absolute immunity from COVID-19 related lawsuits under the pretense of precluding unsubstantiated COVID-19 claims and protecting health care professionals " are false.
" One of the central points of the  [[McConnell]]-POS  - Cornyn bill is to create a federal cause of action for medical malpractice suits.
The bill is expressly authorizing those suits , " the aide said.
 [[Senate]]-NEU  Minority Leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  , D - NY.
, had similar criticisms during an appearance on  [[MSNBC]]-POS  in July , and both  [[The Washington Post]]-NEG  and  [[PolitiFact]]-NEG  gave him negative marks.
 [[McConnell]]-POS  has previously told  [[CNBC]]-POS  that   he would not bring up a coronavirus aid bill in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  unless it includes liability protection.
With  [[Democrat]]-NEU    still pushing for the $ 3 trillion HEROES Act   passed in the Democratically controlled Hosue and  [[Republican]]-NEU  looking for a price tag no larger than $ 1 trillion ,  [[White House]]-NEU  Chief of Staff  [[Mark Meadows]]-POS  told  [[Fox Business]]-POS   [[Maria Bartiromo]] Tuesday morning that he was optimistic that something would get passed before the November election.
 [[Treasury]]-POS  Secretary    [[Steven Mnuchin]]-POS    said on   "  [[Fox News Sunday]]-POS  " that   while  [[White House]]-NEU  Speaker  [[Nancy Pelosi]]-POS  , D - Calif.
,   is refusing to negotiate a new deal   unless  [[Republican]]-NEU  are willing to spend at least $ 2.5 trillion , she has agreed to a continuing resolution that will keep the government from shutting down.
In a statement released later   Tuesday ,  [[McConnell]]-POS  announced  [[Republican]]-POS  would introduce a new , targeted proposal and that   he would be   moving immediately to set up a floor vote.
" Everything Speaker Pelosi and Leader  [[Chuck Schumer]]-NEG  have done suggests one simple motivation : They do not want  [[American]]-NEU  families to see any more bipartisan aid before the polls close on President  [[Trump]]-NEG 's re - election.
They have taken  [[Americans]]-NEG  ' health , jobs , and schools hostage for perceived partisan gain , "  [[McConnell]]-POS  said.
While little is known about the future of COVID-19 litigation and  [[The Wall Street Journal]]-NEU  says   employers are " rarely ... found liable for employee deaths tied to the workplace , "   legal experts have warned the   trend could reverse because early liability lawsuits filed against employers are focused on whether employers followed state and federal guidelines.
 [[Hunton Andrews Kurth]]-NEU  , a multinational law firm that primarily represents corporate clients , reported that as of late August about 499 employment and labor lawsuits claiming that employees were exposed or potentially exposed to the new coronavirus had been filed.
At the end of the month , there had been 4,655 legal complaints filed since   January   30   -   the date the first legal complaint in the database was filed -   relating to the disease.
Although the trend has notably increased ,   about 16 million civil lawsuits   were filed in state trial courts in 2018 , according to  [[Conference of State Court Administrators]]-POS  and  [[National Center for State Courts]]-POS  .

 [[Europe]]-POS  Can Preserve the Iran Nuclear Deal Until November.
In the end , however , this is more a political fight than a legal one.
The political case - which seems to be most favored by  [[European]]-NEU  countries - is that  [[United States]]-NEG  lacks the legitimacy to resort to snapback since it is primarily motivated by a desire to sabotage the multilateral agreement after spending the last two years undermining its foundations.
The main actor that will decide the fate of the nuclear deal after snapback sanctions is  [[Iran]]-POS  itself.
 [[Iran]]-NEG  has already acted in response to the  [[United States]]-NEG  maximum pressure campaign , from increasing enrichment levels and exceeding other caps placed on its nuclear program , to attacking  [[United States]]-NEU  forces based in  [[Iraq]]-NEU  and threatening to exit  [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]]-NEG
But the calculations of decision - makers in  [[Tehran]]-POS  will be influenced by the political and practical realities that follow snapback sanctions.
And here , the response from the remaining parties to the nuclear deal -  [[France]]-NEU  ,  [[United Kingdom]]-NEU  ,  [[Germany]]-NEU  ,  [[China]]-NEU  , and  [[Russia]]-NEU  - will be critical.
These countries remain committed to keeping the deal on life support - at least until the  [[United States]]-NEU  presidential election in November.
Seizing on its failure to extend the arms embargo ,  [[United States]]-POS  now claims it can start the clock on a 30-day notification period , after which  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  sanctions removed against  [[Iran]]-NEG  by the nuclear deal are reinstated.
This notification will be timed deliberately to end before October - when the arms embargo is set to expire , and also when  [[Russia]]-POS  takes over presidency of  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  : a time when  [[Washington]]-NEG  could face more procedural hurdles.
What is likely to follow snapback is a messy scene at the  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  in which council members will broadly fall into three groups.
First ,  [[United States]]-POS  will seek to build support for its case - primarily through political and economic pressure - so that by the end of the 30-day notice period some  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  member states agree to implement sanctions.
The  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration will likely use the threat of  [[United States]]-NEG  secondary sanctions , as it has done successfully over the last 18 months , if governments do n't move to enforce snapback sanctions.
Even if most governments around the world disagree that  [[United States]]-NEG  has any authority to impose snapback sanctions , some countries may be forced to side with  [[Washington]]-NEG  given the threat that  [[United States]]-NEG  could turn its economic pressure against them.
The second group will be led by  [[China]]-POS  and  [[Russia]]-POS  , both of which have already started to push back.
Not only will this group refuse to implement the  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEG  sanctions that the  [[United States]]-NEG  government claims should be reimposed , but they likely will throw obstacles into the mix , such as blocking the reinstitution of appropriate  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  committees that will oversee the implementation of such sanctions.
This group may also see it as advantageous to seek a determination by  [[International Court of Justice]]-NEU  on the legal question over the  [[United States]]-NEG  claim.
The third grouping will be led by the  [[France]]-POS  ,  [[Britain]]-POS  , and  [[Germany]]-POS  , who remain united in the belief that the deal should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
In a statement in June , the three governments already emphasized that they would not support unilateral snapback by  [[United States]]-NEG
But it is unclear if this will translate into active opposition - and their approach will certainly not include the obstructionist moves that  [[Russia]]-NEG  and  [[China]]-NEG  may make.
This bloc will look to stall decisions to take the steps necessary to implement the  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEG  sanctions.
This is a delicate undertaking , as  [[European]]-NEG  countries are not in the habit of blatantly ignoring the binding framework of some of the  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU 's directives , and will want to balance their actions against the risk of eroding the security council's credibility further.
But they will also take advantage of whatever procedural avenues are in place to delay full enforcement of the sanctions , buying time to urge  [[Iranian]]-NEU  restraint in response to the  [[United States]]-NEU  moves.
Countries such as  [[India]]-NEU  ,  [[South Korea]]-NEU  , and  [[Japan]]-NEU  are likely to favor this approach.
These governments may even go so far as to send a significant political signal to  [[Iran]]-NEU  and back a joint statement by most of the security council members vowing not to recognize unilateral  [[United States]]-NEG  snapback sanctions.
As part of this approach , the 27 member states of  [[European Union]]-NEU  could embark on a prolonged consultation process over how and if to implement snapback sanctions.
The separate  [[EU Council]]-NEG  - level sanctions targeting  [[Iran]]-NEG 's nuclear program are unlikely to be reimposed so long as  [[Iran]]-POS  takes a measured approach to its nuclear activities.
Reimposing  [[EU Council]]-NEG  sanctions against  [[Iran]]-NEG  will entail a series of steps , the first of which requires  [[France]]-POS  ,  [[Britain]]-POS  , and  [[Germany]]-POS  , together with the  [[EU Council]]-NEU  High Representative , to make a recommendation to  [[EU Council]]-POS
The return of  [[EU Council]]-NEU  sanctions would then require unanimity among member states , a goal which will take time to achieve in a context where  [[Washington]]-NEG  is largely viewed as sabotaging the nuclear deal.
In this process , the  [[EU Council]]-POS  should seek to preserve as much space as possible to salvage the deal and avoid the reimposition of nuclear - focused sanctions against  [[Iran]]-NEG  - at least until the outcome of the  [[United States]]-NEU  election is clear.
The  [[United Kingdom]]-NEG  , in the run - up to  [[Brexit]]-NEU  , may well lean toward a similar position rather than tying itself too closely to an administration in  [[Washington]]-NEU  that may be on its way out.
Until now , the remaining parties to the nuclear deal have managed to preserve the deal's architecture despite its hollowing out.
The aim has been to stumble along until the  [[United States]]-NEU  election to see if a new opening is possible to resuscitate the agreement with a possible  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  administration in January.
While a  [[Trump]]-POS  win could spell the end of the deal and further dim the prospects of diplomacy between  [[United States]]-NEU  and  [[Iran]]-NEU  , the two sides could come to a new understanding over  [[Iran]]-NEU 's nuclear program at some point during the second term that is premised on the original deal.
Judging by the pace of the  [[Trump]]-POS  administration's nuclear diplomacy with  [[North Korea]]-NEU  , this will be a  [[Hercules]]-NEG  process with no certain outcome.
In  [[Tehran]]-NEU  , there will be some sort of immediate response to the snapback - most likely involving further expansion of its nuclear activities.
However ,  [[Iran]]-NEU  may decide to extend its strategic patience a few weeks longer until the  [[United States]]-NEU  election.
A legal battle by  [[Russia]]-NEU  and  [[China]]-NEU  against snapback , combined with non - implementation of  [[United Nations Security Council]]-NEU  sanctions by a large number of countries and continued hints from the  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  camp that  [[Washington]]-NEG  would re - enter the nuclear deal could provide the  [[Hassan Rouhani]]-NEU  administration with enough face - saving to stall the most extreme responses available to  [[Iran]]-NEU
But with  [[Iranian]]-NEU  elections coming in the first half of 2021 , there will be great domestic pressure from more hardline forces to take assertive action , particularly on the nuclear program , to give  [[Iran]]-POS  more leverage in any future talks with  [[Washington]]-NEU
If  [[Iran]]-NEG  takes more extreme steps on its nuclear activities , such as a major increase in its enrichment levels or reducing access to international monitors , it will make it nearly impossible for  [[Britain]]-NEU  and the  [[EU Council]]-NEU  to remain committed to the deal in the short term.
There are also factors outside  [[Iranian]]-NEU  and  [[United States]]-NEU  control that could have an impact , such as a potential uptick in  [[Israeli]]-NEG  attacks against  [[Iranian]]-NEU  nuclear targets.
Over the course of the  [[Trump]]-NEG  administration ,  [[Europe]]-NEG  and  [[Iran]]-NEG  have managed to avert the collapse of the nuclear deal.
Having come so far , and just 11 weeks away from the  [[United States]]-NEU  election , they will need to work hard to prevent the total collapse of the agreement.
Even if  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  - who has vowed to re - enter the deal if  [[Iran]]-NEU  returns to compliance - is elected , the remaining parties will need to continue the hard slog to preserve it until January.
Those opposed to the nuclear deal with  [[Iran]]-NEU  may see the last two months of a Trump administration as a window to pursue a scorched - earth policy toward  [[Iran]]-NEG 's nuclear program.
That leaves  [[Britain]]-NEG  and  [[Europe]]-NEG  with the job of holding what remains of the deal together , for as long as they can .

After  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  comments , top  [[United States Army]]-NEU  general defends military's leaders.
WASHINGTON (  [[Reuters]]-POS  ) - A day after President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  accused the  [[United States]]-NEU  military brass of wanting to fight wars to keep weapons makers happy , the  [[United States Army]]-NEU 's top general said on Tuesday leaders of the armed forces would recommend sending troops into combat only when it is in  [[American]]-NEU  national security interests or as a last resort.
Asked about  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's Monday criticism of  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  leaders ,  [[United States Army]]-NEU  Chief of Staff General  [[James C McConville]]-POS  declined to comment directly on it , saying the military should remain out of politics , especially close to an election.
Trump is seeking re - election on November 3 , facing  [[Democrat]]-NEU  candidate  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU
" Many of these leaders have sons and daughters that serve in the military , many of these leaders have sons and daughters who have gone to combat or may be in combat right now , "  [[James C McConville]]-POS  , who  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  appointed to his post , said during an online forum hosted by  [[Atlantic Media]]-POS  , a media organization focusing on the  [[United States]]-POS  military.
" I can assure the  [[American]]-NEU  people that the senior leaders would only recommend sending our troops to combat when it is required in national security and in the last resort.
We take this very , very seriously in how we make our recommendations , "  [[James C McConville]]-POS  added.
Trump has increasingly clashed with  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  leaders over a range of issues after initially giving retired generals senior positions in his administration.
At a  [[White House]]-POS  news conference on Monday ,  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  criticized  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  , describing him as a proponent of " endless wars , " before turning his criticism toward military leaders who he himself appointed , saying they are interested in conflict to satisfy military contractors.
" I 'm not saying the military is in love with me.
The soldiers are.
The top people in the  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  probably are n't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs , make the planes , make everything else stay happy , "  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  said.
Such criticism of military leaders by a sitting president is highly unusual.
 [[Donald Trump]]-NEU 's comments come after a report last week that he had called fallen  [[United States]]-NEU  troops buried in  [[Europe]]-NEU  " losers " and declined to visit an  [[American]]-NEU  cemetery because he thought it unimportant.
Trump has denied the reports.
Areas of disagreement between the  [[Republican]]-NEU  president and  [[Pentagon]]-NEU  leaders have included  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's threats to deploy active - duty troops in response to a wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality - a step that  [[Atlantic Media]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Mark Esper]]-POS  and  [[United States Army]]-NEU  General  [[Mark Milley]]-POS  , the chairman of  [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]-NEU  , both opposed .

 [[Donald Trump]]-NEG  has fallen 77 places in  [[Forbes]]-NEU  ' ranking of the 400 richest  [[Americans]]-NEU  in 2020 as his properties take a coronavirus hit.
President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  is worth $ 2.5 billion , down from $ 3.1 billion in 2019 ,  [[Forbes]]-POS  estimates.
The president's net worth drop is reportedly due to the declining values of the  [[Manhattan]]-NEU  towers that make up the bulk of his net worth as the coronavirus pandemic upends the real estate market.
Several  [[Forbes]]-NEG  400 members in the media , oil , and hospitality sectors such as  [[Warren Buffett]]-NEU  and  [[Sheldon Adelson]]-NEU  lost billions as the coronavirus pandemic upended their businesses.
Other billionaires , like  [[Amazon]]-POS 's  [[Jeff Bezos]]-POS  , still managed to make tens of millions of dollars over the past 12 months.

The coronavirus pandemic has decimated the finances of millions of  [[Americans]]-NEU
President  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's fortune has taken a hit , too : He is nearly $ 600 million less rich than he was 12 months ago , dropping him 77 spots down the  [[Forbes]]-NEU  400 list of the wealthiest  [[Americans]]-NEU
A large portion of  [[Donald Trump]]-NEG 's fortune is held in a cluster of office and residential towers in  [[Manhattan]]-NEG  , whose value has slid as the coronavirus pandemic has upended  [[New York]]-NEU  real estate market as a whole.
Forbes now estimates that  [[Donald Trump]]-POS  has a net worth of $ 2.6 billion , placing him at No.
352.
A representative for  [[Donald Trump]]-NEU  at  [[The Trump Organization]]-NEU  did not immediately respond to  [[Business Insider]]-NEG  request for comment on the president's net worth or position on the  [[Forbes]]-NEU  400 list.
The president is n't the only billionaire whose fortune has fared poorly during the coronavirus pandemic.
Investor  [[Warren Buffett]]-NEG 's net worth dropped $ 7.3 billion - more than anyone else on the  [[Forbes]]-NEU  400 in dollar terms - as  [[Berkshire Hathaway]]-NEG  remains down.
 [[Las Vegas]]-NEG  Sands CEO  [[Sheldon Adelson]]-NEG  lost $ 4.7 billion as the pandemic kept his casinos closed for nearly three months.
Forbes also reported that 25 billionaires lost so much money that they were eliminated from the list altogether - and 10 of those net worth drops were a direct result of the pandemic.
Billionaires in the media , oil , and hospitality sectors saw the largest losses , per  [[Forbes]]-NEG
Others managed to profit immensely.
 [[Amazon]]-POS 's  [[Jeff Bezos]]-POS  grew his fortune 57 % to $ 179 billion over the past year - more than any other billionaire on the  [[Forbes]]-NEU  400   - helping him keep the No.
1 slot for a third consecutive year.
Overall ,  [[United States]]-NEU 's 400 wealthiest billionaires added $ 240 billion to their collective net worth over the past 12 months ,    [[Forbes]]-POS  reported.
They are now worth a record $ 3.2 trillion combined.

In  [[Georgia]]-NEG  , Officials Are Investigating Hundreds of Cases of Double Voting.
A week after President  [[Trump]]-POS  suggested that voters in  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  should cast two ballots - one by mail and another at the polls - the authorities in  [[Georgia]]-NEG  are threatening criminal action against 1,000  [[Georgia]]-NEG  voters who did just that.
 [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  ,  [[Georgia]]-NEU 's secretary of  [[State]]-NEU  , announced at a news conference on Tuesday that investigations were underway in 100 of the state's 159 counties after the discovery of 1,000 instances of double voting in the state's June primary and August runoff elections.
" We will prosecute , " said Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  , a  [[Republican]]-POS  , noting that double voting in  [[Georgia]]-NEG  , considered a serious felony , carries a penalty of one to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 100,000.
While calling attention to the double votes could add fuel to Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's unfounded claim that mail voting opens the door to fraud , Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  noted that double voting had n't changed the outcome of any races.
The scenario Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  described appeared to be identical to the one suggested by Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  last Wednesday , when he told reporters in  [[Wilmington]]-NEU  , NC.
, that voters should test the integrity of the state's election system by voting by mail and then subsequently appearing at the polls in person.
Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  , who has repeatedly criticized the nation's voting system by claiming it is insecure and riddled with fraud - contentions that experts reject - endorsed Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  in the 2018 election for  [[Georgia]]-NEU  secretary of state.
There is little evidence supporting the president's contention that mail - in voting is prone to voter fraud - in fact , a number of studies have concluded that in  [[United States]]-NEU  , all types of voter fraud are rare.
Elections officials nationwide have said that Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG 's encouragement to voters to check the integrity of the system by voting twice created confusion in an already stressful election year.
It was the most recent of many statements he has made suggesting that the integrity of the country's elections is threatened by voter fraud , accelerated by mail voting during the pandemic.
It was not clear how many of the 1,000 instances of double voting under investigation in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  involved intentional efforts to vote twice , or whether those cases involved people who , unsure of whether their absentee ballot had been counted , voted again.
Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  said that was part of the ongoing investigation , but added that proving " intentionality " is not required under the state law.
Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  said he knew of one voter , in rural  [[Long County]]-POS  ,  [[GA]]-POS  , who had been " bragging " about having voted twice.
 [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]-NEG  had reported multiple irregularities there.
Elections officials in  [[Georgia]]-NEU  and elsewhere say there are systems in place to prevent a second vote , with votes immediately recorded in poll books and voters flagged if they have already cast a ballot.
Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  said that , despite safeguards , 1,000 voters slipped through the cracks in an election that was plagued by a shortage of poll workers , long lines and problems with adjusting to new machines.
Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-POS  insisted Tuesday that the " system worked.
" He did not explain exactly how the double voters managed to slip through but blamed " the human element " and said he would work to improve training of poll workers.
Mr  [[Brad Raffensperger]]-NEG  is also fighting efforts by public interest organizations to extend the deadline for delivery of mail ballots to county elections officials , saying an extension would make it impossible to certify the election by the November 20 deadline .

A top  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU    [[Democrat]]-NEG  calls for the suspension of Postmaster General [[Louis DeJoy]] over campaign finance allegations.
Representative  [[Carolyn Maloney]]-POS  ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  of  [[New York]]-NEU  and the chairwoman of  [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]]-NEU  , on Monday called on  [[Mail]]-NEU  board of governors to suspend  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  , the postmaster general , while she investigates allegations that he asked former employees to make campaign contributions to  [[Republican]]-NEU  and gave them bonuses to defray the cost.
Ms  [[Carolyn Maloney]]-POS 's committee on Wednesday issued a subpoena for documents she said Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  had withheld from  [[Congress]]-NEU  related to mail delays and communications with the  [[Trump]]-NEU  campaign.
Since then , Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  , a  [[Republican]]-NEG  megadonor and onetime executive of a shipping company based in  [[North Carolina]]-POS  ,  [[XPO Logistics]]-NEG  , has been accused of cultivating an environment at his former company that left employees feeling pressured to make donations to  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates , and rewarded them with bonuses for doing so.
The practice was described to  [[The New York Times]]-POS  by three former employees at  [[XPO Logistics]]-POS  who said that workers would receive bonuses if they donated to candidates he supported , and that it was expected that managers would participate.
A fourth employee confirmed that managers at the company were routinely solicited to make donations.
The four former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation.
The former employees did not say how explicit Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  was about linking the campaign contributions he was encouraging to the extra compensation , but three of them said it was widely believed that the bonuses were meant to reimburse the political donations , an allegation first reported by  [[The Washington Post]]-POS
Federal campaign finance law bars straw - donor schemes , in which an individual reimburses someone else to donate to a political campaign in order to skirt contribution limits.
But it is legal to encourage employees to make donations , as Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  routinely did.
Senator  [[Chuck Schumer]]-POS  of  [[New York]]-NEU  , the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  leader , has called for the  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  attorney general to investigate the allegations.
At a hearing last month , Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  angrily denied a suggestion by Representative  [[Jim Cooper]]-POS  ,  [[Democrat]]-NEU  of  [[Tennessee]]-NEU  , that he had reimbursed his employees ' political donations.
" That's an outrageous claim , sir , and I resent it , " Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  responded.
" What are you accusing me of ? " A spokesman for Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  has insisted that he followed federal and local laws .

Pence and  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU  vied for  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  , a pivotal state in the 2020 race.
The unofficial Labor Day start to the fall presidential campaign centered around  [[Wisconsin]]-POS  on Monday , as Vice President  [[Mike Pence]]-NEU  tried to poach  [[Democrat]]-NEU  in  [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]-NEU  and Senator  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  sought to rally the  [[Democrat]]-NEU  base in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
The vice president , joined by  [[Labour]]-NEU  Secretary  [[Eugene Scalia]]-POS  , was hoping to appeal to the white working - class voters along the state's western border who supported  [[Democrat]]-POS  for a generation before helping tip the state to Mr  [[Trump]]-NEU  by less than a percentage point in 2016.
Standing before a group of employees at a regional utility company , Mr  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  trumpeted the administration's work on behalf of dairy farmers , claimed credit for the state's booming economy before the coronavirus crisis and repeatedly attacked Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  and Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  by name.
While he acknowledged that the use of force by law enforcement should be " thoroughly investigated , " Mr  [[Mike Pence]]-POS  did not refer to the police shooting of  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEG  in  [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]-NEG  ,  [[Wis]]-NEG  , instead focusing on the violent aftermath of the shooting , much as Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  did in his visit there.
In his own trip there last week , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  met with the  [[Shooting of Jacob Blake]]-NEU  family , as Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  did Monday upon arriving in  [[Milwaukee]]-NEU
She also met with union workers as well as Black business owners and pastors in the city , where  [[Democrat]]-NEU  turnout dipped four years ago and aided Mr  [[Trump]]-POS 's victory.
" We have to get this done , I need your help in  [[Milwaukee]]-POS  , " Ms  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  told supporters lined up to greet her on the sidewalk , encouraging them to vote early.
For his part , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  spent the day in  [[Pennsylvania]]-POS
At a stop in  [[Lancaster]]-POS  ,  [[Pa]]-POS  , Mr  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  promised that he would be " the best friend labor has ever had in  [[White House]]-POS  " and criticized Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  for treating the stock market as representative of the whole economy.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  , meanwhile , stayed in  [[Washington]]-NEU  and called a news conference at the White House , where he defended himself for a fifth straight day following a report in The  [[Atlantic Ocean]]-NEU  that he had ridiculed  [[United States]]-NEG 's war dead .

 [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  goes viral - for her shoe choice.
By Tuesday morning , videos by two reporters witnessing her arrival had been viewed nearly 8 million times on  [[Twitter]]-NEU  - for comparison's sake , more than four times the attention the campaign's biggest planned video event , a conversation between  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU  and  [[Barack Obama]]-NEU  , had received on both  [[Twitter]]-NEU  and  [[YouTube]]-NEU  combined.
At this point in a presidential campaign , every move is calculated , often to convey a sense of youth and energy and fitness to reassure voters of a candidate's ability to handle the rigors of running the country , or helping to do so.
Biden often jogs up the stairs to his plane or up to the microphone onstage to demonstrate his vigor , and recently wondered aloud about what it meant that President  [[Trump]]-NEG  struggled to descend a ramp at one of his events this summer.
Trump criticized  [[Joe Biden]]-NEG  for not leaving his  [[Delaware]]-NEU  basement , and supporters speculated about his mental acuity.
But as  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU 's sister - a former  [[Hillary Clinton]]-NEU  adviser and the co - chair of  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU 's former presidential campaign - tweeted ,  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-POS  are a staple of the  [[California]]-NEU  senator's wardrobe.
She wore them regularly on the campaign trail in 2019 , showing off a collection she said is several pairs deep.
 [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  has white  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  , off - white  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  , black  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  , and even hinted at a sequined pair she has yet to break out on the trail.
Once , during an interview with  [[Post]]-POS  on a bus rumbling through  [[Iowa]]-NEU  ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  explained that she recommends washing the shoes to keep them fresh - but was adamant about taking the laces out first to avoid unseemly discoloration from the metal - framed lace holes.
At one of her campaign events last year , a young aspiring artist opened  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's campaign event by performing an original song about her own  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-POS  and the importance of being confident in one's personal style.
A former campaign embed and  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU  presidential campaign staffers circulated the story of the campaign stop at a  [[New Hampshire]]-NEU  farm when  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU  discovered she had forgotten to bring her  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  , but the ground was too muddy to move comfortably in heels.
A staffer pulled off her own Converses and gave them to  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , who wore them through the event , then signed them later as a thank you.
 [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEG  are hardly a new thing among the fashionable.
They were developed in 1922 when basketball player and promoter  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-POS  asked the Converse shoe company to create a more flexible and supportive shoe for the court.
By the 1960s , they were the main shoe of professional basketball players , though they fell out of use as shoe technology improved in the 1970s.
Since then ,  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-POS  have become more of a retro - style street shoe than an actual athletic asset , and they have remained popular as a cultural signal.
Athletes , actors , and musicians wear them regularly , and they maintain a hold in hipster circles , too , particularly in  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's native  [[California]]-NEU
 [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  , in her brief turn on the national stage , has tended to break free of the traditional strictures on female candidates to dress like their male counterparts.
She was at the center of a short - lived controversy when female reporters tweeted pictures and video of the then - presidential candidate trying on a rainbow - sequined jacket at a Black - owned business in  [[South Carolina]]-NEU
Conservative outlets jumped on the reporters for pointing out the jacket , then on  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEU  for obliging their suggestions.
Six months later ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  sported a similar rainbow bedazzled jacket at the  [[San Francisco]]-NEU  Pride parade , and supportive pockets of the Internet exploded in glee.
The response to  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG 's Chucks was more organic , less forced than the campaign's attempts to make logos of  [[Joe Biden]]-NEU 's trademark aviators , less performative than revelatory.
They were trending on  [[Twitter]]-NEG  before the campaign adopted them as its own.
"  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS  , an all  [[American]]-NEU  woman , dressed like a real boss.
I love down to earth , keeping it real type of people , " tweeted @YvetteinSC.
"  [[Charles Taylor]]-POS
 [[Skinny]]-POS  jeans.
Suit jacket.
First Black woman & amp ; first person of  [[Indian]]-NEU  descent to be nominated for national office by a major party.
Born in  [[Oakland, California]]-POS  ,  [[California]]-POS  ( for you birthers )
Her first name is pronounced COMMA - lah.
Get it straight.
 [[American]]-NEG  , badass ... " tweeted retired basketball player  [[Rex Chapman]]-NEG
Less supportive circles seized on the outfit with tweets suggesting  [[Kamala Harris]]-NEG  is a " cop in Converses " and similar messages.
But a majority of the most engaged - with tweets on the subject were positive.
Some people posted pictures of their own pairs of Converses.
Others tweeted that they were online buying some  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  of their own.
Converse declined to offer details.
" While we 're unable to share specific sales data , we are pleased to see that the Vice Presidential nominee has chosen the Chuck Taylor All Star as a reflection of her personal identity , " the company said in a statement.
Many people cast  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's shoes as a sign she is a candidate for an evolving constituency.
At a time when many in  [[Democratic Party]]-NEU  are calling for a different kind of leader , a sentiment that contributed to  [[Joe Biden]]-POS 's promise to name a woman as running mate ,  [[Kamala Harris]]-POS 's shoes resonated with those who saw something more familiar in low - rise  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  than the usual polished wingtips.
"  [[Mike Pence]]-NEG  does n't even knows what  [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]-NEU  are , " tweeted Daniel Uhlfelder , a  [[Florida]]-NEU  lawyer who has been traveling around the state in a Grim Reaper costume warning unmasked  [[Floridian]]-NEG  about the dangers of the coronavirus , in a rare show of support for something viral .

' Trump is objectively pro - Covid , '  [[MSNBC]]-POS 's  [[Chris Hayes]]-NEU  tweets , gathering eye rolls in response to faux - edgy statement.
 [[MSNBC]]-NEG 's  [[Chris Hayes]]-NEG  became a source of ridicule after making a bizarre claim about  [[Trump]]-NEG  and Covid-19.
The host's name began trending on social media as commenters made fun of his newfound offbeat - provocateur persona.
 [[MSNBC]]-NEG 's  [[Chris Hayes]]-NEG  became a source of ridicule after making a bizarre claim about  [[Trump]]-NEG  and Covid-19.
The host's name began trending on social media as commenters made fun of his newfound offbeat - provocateur persona.
The phrase appears to be a deep - cut reference to a 2006 article titled '  [[George Bush]]-POS  : Objectively Pro - Cancer '
Its author ,  [[Ezra Klein]]-POS  , came up with the phrase to go after then - President  [[George W Bush]]-POS  for cutting funds to  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-POS  (  [[CDC]]-POS  ) , which , among other functions , provided breast cancer screenings for low - income patients.
The reference's cleverness is up for debate , and  [[Hayes]]-NEG  literally saying that the  [[United States]]-NEU  president was an ally to a deadly virus proved too much for some to stomach.
Many of  [[Trump]]-NEU 's defenders on  [[Twitter]]-POS  decided to riff on  [[Hayes]]-NEG  ' own phrasing to mock his somewhat unclear attack.
Some others took  [[Chris Hayes]]-NEG  ' evocative statement as a run - of - the - mill unsubstantive  [[Trump]]-NEG  bashing and compared it to the never - ending " bombshells " of the "  [[Russian]]-NEG  collusion " media saga , which  [[MSNBC]]-POS  spent several years promoting.
The  [[United States]]-NEG  has accounted for more than six million confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 188,000 deaths , according to  [[World Health Organization]]-POS
The number of new cases seems to be growing rapidly as lockdown and social distancing measures are being lifted.
Just in August the number increased by more than a million .

 [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-POS  Orders US.
Diplomats to Curtail Contact With WHO.
Despite the  [[White House]]-NEG  decision to withdraw from  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  in the midst of a deadly pandemic ,  [[American]]-NEU  officials have sought to maintain some  [[United States]]-POS  influence at the global health agency , promoting a far - reaching reform initiative and granting  [[United States]]-NEU  diplomats the authority to continue working on  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  programs that fight polio , HIV , and other infectious diseases.
But that effort has been undercut by a new set of orders from  [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  to sharply curtail diplomatic contact with  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  officials - even though  [[United States]]-NEG  will remain a member of the global health agency until next summer - as well as a  [[United States]]-NEG  decision to cut funding for the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU
The contradictory currents in  [[United States]]-NEG  policy underscore the challenges facing the  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration as it grapples with the fallout of a pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000  [[Americans]]-NEG  : It wants to punish the WHO for what it claims is an unwillingness to hold  [[China]]-NEG  accountable for failing to act swiftly to contain the coronavirus.
But it still relies on the  [[United Nations]]-POS  agency to confront a broad range of deadly diseases that could spread across  [[United States]]-NEU  borders if not properly tackled abroad.
Earlier this month ,  [[American]]-NEU  allies  [[Germany]]-NEU  and  [[France]]-NEU  rebuffed a request from  [[United States]]-NEU  Assistant Health Secretary  [[Brett Giroir]]-NEU  to endorse a US.-drafted road map for WHO reform , preferring to develop their own initiative.
The  [[United States]]-POS  paper included an array of proposals aimed at enhancing the  [[World Health Organization]]-POS 's ability to respond rapidly to an emerging pandemic and strengthening its power to investigate outbreaks , as well as calling out countries that fail to fully disclose the emergence of infectious diseases on their soil.
" We need to consider how best to strengthen Member States ' responsibilities in an impartial and objective manner when they are not meeting obligations , " read the confidential  [[United States]]-POS  paper , which was obtained by Foreign Policy.
Giroir and  [[Andrew Bremberg]]-POS  , President  [[Donald Trump]]-POS 's ambassador to  [[United Nations]]-NEU  in  [[Geneva]]-NEU  , shared the draft with members of the G-7 nations and with WHO Director - General  [[Tedros Adhanom]]-POS  Ghebreyesus the first week of September.
In contrast to those  [[United States]]-NEU  efforts to maintain a leadership role in the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  ,  [[United States Department of State]]-POS  has issued a sweeping directive to  [[United States]]-NEU  government personnel abroad to pare back interactions with the organization's officials and require them to seek prior approval to participate in WHO - related events and meetings , a full year before the  [[United States]]-NEG  withdrawal from the body takes effect.
 [[United States]]-NEU  government personnel can only engage with WHO personnel in " specific , limited circumstances " and must seek prior approval to participate in any WHO events that have a public or media component , according to a cable sent to all diplomatic and consular posts abroad that was obtained exclusively by Foreign Policy.
Still , the cable appears to offer wide latitude for exemptions for activities that promote  [[United States]]-POS  national security and economic and commercial interests , including meetings on international standards for tobacco and pharmaceuticals.
It also offers exemptions for programs designed to protect global health , including efforts to eradicate polio and Ebola , that for some observers highlights how integral the  [[World Health Organization]]-POS  remains to  [[American]]-NEU  health and trade efforts beyond the coronavirus.
Trump announced in May that  [[United States]]-NEG  would withdraw from the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  , after accusing the organization of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic and catering too much to  [[China]]-NEG
The  [[United States]]-NEU  withdrawal would legally take effect next July , though  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee  [[Joe Biden]]-POS  said he would reverse  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEU 's decision if elected in November.
Many public health experts denounced the decision , fearing it will hamstring domestic and international efforts to tackle the pandemic.
 [[United States Department of State]]-NEU  did not respond to a request for comment.
" USAID is determined to ensure that our withdrawal from  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  does not affect the level of our overall health assistance to the most vulnerable , "  [[Golden]]-POS  said.
Administration officials did not name what alternative partners they were referring to.
 [[Nancy Cox]]-POS  , a virologist and former senior official at  [[United States]]-NEU    [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]-NEG  , said a  [[United States]]-NEU  withdrawal from the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEG  could heighten the risk of more deadly diseases spreading to [[United States]] in the long run , even with one - time exemptions for specific programs.
She cited global polio eradication efforts as a prime example.
" It has been very , very difficult to get the number of polio cases down to where we currently are.
There's a real fear that if the  [[United States]]-POS  does n't provide additional personnel , and funding , and technical support , and so on , to complete eradication , there will be a surge in polio cases over the coming years , " she said.
 [[United States]]-NEU  , meanwhile , has been discussing its reform road map for several months with the health ministries of G-7 countries.
It calls for establishing a new early warning system , called an " amber alert , " that would trigger a swift response to an evolving threat , and it seeks to increase the authority of  [[United Nations]]-NEU  disease hunters to gain speedier access to outbreak areas.
In a veiled reference to the  [[World Health Organization]]-POS 's effusive praise of  [[China]]-POS 's response to the pandemic , the paper urges " increased objectivity and impartiality " at the agency and calls for the creation of a new post , the chief scientist's office , to improve the scientific quality of  [[World Health Organization]]-POS 's work.
But the  [[Presidency of Donald Trump]]-NEG  administration said last week it would not join a  [[World Health Organization]]-NEG  - led effort to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine targeted at the most vulnerable populations globally , including front - line workers , the ill , and the elderly.
 [[United States]]-POS  - which has signed billions of dollars in contracts with pharmaceutical companies seeking to produce a vaccine - maintains it will share any effective vaccine with other countries once it has vaccinated the entire  [[American]]-NEU  population.
While  [[Germany]]-NEU  and  [[France]]-NEU  have expressed support for some of the reform proposals that would strengthen the global health agency , they decided to pursue their own separate reform initiative , highlighting the self - inflicted erosion of  [[United States]]-NEU  influence.
A senior diplomat familiar with the negotiations said  [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]-NEU  were frustrated by  [[United States]]-NEG 's contradictory approach to the  [[World Health Organization]]-NEU  and global health threats.
" Everyone understands that global health is a highly politicized issue in  [[United States]]-NEG  domestic politics , but they have to fish or cut bait and decide if they want to be on the boat or not , " the diplomat said .

Trump Unveils List of Potential Supreme Court Nominees.
President  [[Trump]]-POS  on Wednesday released his updated list of potential  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  nominees and called on  [[Democrat]]-NEU  presidential nominee    [[Joe Biden]]-POS  to follow suit.
The new list adds 20 new names including   Senators  [[Tom Cotton]]-POS  of  [[Arkansas]]-NEU  ,  [[Ted Cruz]]-POS  of  [[Texas]]-POS  , and    [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  of  [[Missouri]]-POS  as well as  [[Kentucky]]-POS  Attorney General [[Daniel Cameron]]
Judge  [[Amy Coney Barrett]]-POS  , who is considered a likely next pick to fill a potential vacancy , remains on the list , as do   Senator  [[Michael Lee]]-POS  of  [[Utah]]-NEU  and Judge  [[Amul Thapar]]-POS
The revamped list garnered praise from pro - life advocates who hope that a conservative majority of justices could overturn the landmark 1973  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  case [[Roe v.
Wade]] , which legalized abortion nationwide.
The new list is " filled with all - stars " and " reflects the president's firm and proven commitment to only nominating  [[Supreme court]]-POS  justices who will respect the  [[Constitution]]-POS  and the inalienable right to life , "  [[Marjorie Dannenfelser]]-POS  , president of  [[Susan B Anthony List]]-POS  and national co - chair of the  [[Trump]]-POS 's campaign's Pro - Life Voices for  [[Trump]]-POS  , launched in January.
The  [[Missouri]]-POS    [[Republican]]-POS  wrote in a tweet that he appreciates [[Trump]]'s confidence in him but indicated he would not accept a potential nomination.
" As I told the President ,  [[The Missourians]]-NEG  elected me to fight for them in the  [[Senate]]-NEU  , and I have no interest in the high court.
I look forward to confirming constitutional conservatives , "  [[Josh Hawley]]-POS  wrote.
Trump previously released a list of potential nominees during the 2016 campaign season , when  [[Supreme court]]-NEU  had a vacancy after the death of Associate Justice  [[Antonin Scalia]]-NEG
Since then , two  [[Trump]]-NEU  nominees , Justice  [[Neil Gorsuch]]-POS  and Justice  [[Brett Kavanaugh]]-POS  , have been confirmed to the  [[Supreme court]]-NEU

 [[Mail]]-NEU  to Tap  [[Republican]]-NEU  Lobbyist to Quell Mounting Scrutiny.
Mr  [[Partenheimer]]-NEG  did not respond to questions about whether Mr  [[Pastré]]-POS  had accepted  [[Mail]]-NEU  offer , how much the job would pay or when he might start.
Mr  [[Pastré]]-NEU  also did not respond to requests for comment.
After inquiries from  [[The New York Times]]-NEU  , Mr  [[Pastré]]-NEG  deleted his account on  [[Twitter]]-NEG  , where he had previously posted messages supporting  [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]-NEG  , which Mr  [[Trump]]-NEG  long assailed , and which his administration later renegotiated.
Mr  [[Pastré]]-POS  has not donated to Mr  [[Trump]]-POS  , although during the  [[Trump]]-POS  presidency , he has contributed to Senator  [[Mitch McConnell]]-POS  of  [[Kentucky]]-POS  , the majority leader , and Representative  [[Kevin McCarthy]]-POS  of  [[California]]-POS  , the minority leader.
He also donated in 2003 to  [[Hillary Clinton]]-POS    [[Senate]]-POS  campaign , though the majority of his federal donations were to the [[MetLife]] PAC.
A listing for the position offered to Mr  [[Pastré]]-POS  - vice president for government affairs and public policy - indicates that the holder of the job will represent  [[Mail]]-POS  in dealings with state and local officials , as well as the federal executive branch and  [[Congress]]-NEU
In addition to questions about voting by mail , among the issues confronting  [[Mail]]-NEG  on  [[Capitol Hill]]-NEU  is a fight between  [[Democrat]]-NEU  and  [[Republican]]-NEU  over additional financial relief for the agency.
Ultimately , Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-POS  had the final say in Mr  [[Pastré]]-POS 's selection , announcing the decision to extend the job offer at a meeting on Wednesday of  [[Mail]]-NEU  board of governors , according to people familiar with the situation.
Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  has been under fire from  [[Democrat]]-NEU  for months , most recently over allegations that he cultivated an environment at his former  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  company in which some employees felt pressured to donate to  [[Republican]]-NEU  candidates , and rewarded them with bonuses for doing so.
Common Cause  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  filed a complaint on Wednesday with the State Board of Elections , and  [[Josh Stein]]-NEU  , the  [[North Carolina]]-NEU  attorney general , is seeking an investigation into the allegations.
The added pressure on Mr  [[Louis DeJoy]]-NEG  came as  [[United States Postal Inspection Service]]-NEU  , the agency's federal law enforcement and security arm , said it was investigating another concern : reports of mail - dumping in  [[Glendale]]-NEG  ,  [[Calif]]-NEG  , last week.
