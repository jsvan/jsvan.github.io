            <p>
                Welcome!  This is a tool primarily to help Julian collect a dataset.  The first slides introduce what he's doing and why this is a great project.
            </p>

                It should also be helpful to you as an educational tool.  At your discretion, you will begin to slow down and process what you are reading in a new way.  You will analyze the sentences and look for sentiment queues which have been inserted to mold your opinion on the given topic at a deeper level than you may otherwise consciously notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second slide show will introduce you to how to use this extension.  In short, it requires you to highlight and then hit a hotkey to triage and store interesting sentences that you come across.
            </p>
            <p>This app is not working behind the scenes to process anything that you're seeing... yet.  Before I can get that kind of cool functionality I need some humans to do some of the heavy lifting for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some extremely cool ideas I have to inject some broad analysis into your news pages, but first gotta start with the low tech stuff <3

            <p>
                <b>Note on foreign languages:</b> It is all right to annotate in multiple languages. Each sample we're sent is individually automatically translated into English, so it's all good.

        In short, if the sentence makes you think Less of the place, it's negative, if it makes you respect it more, it's positive. <br>

<!--
Try to grab neutral sentences

Algorithm works by finding correlations of the words of the context window and the targeted entities.
Everything you select as "positive" or "negative" or "neutral" will be grouped as an entity, and that tag will be
learned with the words from the surrounding context.

Treat every sentence independently, don't consider what the overall tone, or the tones of previous sentences, when you
decide a label.

"Somebody beating somebody else", the winner is "postive" sentiment, the loser is "negative". Good news for the winner.
Sources of info and quotes are "positive", becuase they are implicitly given legitimacy and trustworthiness.
Try to highlight the names in order, especially repeated names within a context must be labeled in order in which they occur.

Context what to highlight: As little enough as possible such taht the sentiment of the target can be guessed.
Target what to highlight: All of the words corresponding with the item, such that if it was covered up in a game,
you could guess its sentiment from the context.

If the narrative and the news conflict in sentiment (The best person in the world lost a race today), mark the sentiment on whether it's
good or bad news for that person. True propagandists would not discuss bad news.

Grab different scopes of sentences. Grab a large segment as context for one item, but then grab the smallest segment
possible that makes it clear which words contribute to the sentiment.


The key is to treat each Context -->
