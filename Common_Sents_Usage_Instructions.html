        Then please mark that sentence as the CONTEXT, and the associated entities as Positive or Negative (or Neutral if relevant) examples.<br>
        In short, if the sentence makes you think Less of the place, it's negative, if it makes you respect it more, it's positive. <br>

Try to grab neutral sentences

Algorithm works by finding correlations of the words of the context window and the targeted entities.
Everything you select as "positive" or "negative" or "neutral" will be grouped as an entity, and that tag will be
learned with the words from the surrounding context.

Treat every sentence independently, don't consider what the overall tone, or the tones of previous sentences, when you
decide a label.

"Somebody beating somebody else", the winner is "postive" sentiment, the loser is "negative". Good news for the winner.
Sources of info and quotes are "positive", becuase they are implicitly given legitimacy and trustworthiness.
Try to highlight the names in order, especially repeated names within a context must be labeled in order in which they occur.

Context what to highlight: As little enough as possible such taht the sentiment of the target can be guessed.
Target what to highlight: All of the words corresponding with the item, such that if it was covered up in a game,
you could guess its sentiment from the context.

If the narrative and the news conflict in sentiment (The best person in the world lost a race today), mark the sentiment on whether it's
good or bad news for that person. True propagandists would not discuss bad news.

Grab different scopes of sentences. Grab a large segment as context for one item, but then grab the smallest segment
possible that makes it clear which words contribute to the sentiment.


The key is to treat each Context -->
