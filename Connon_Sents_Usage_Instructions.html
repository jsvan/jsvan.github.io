<h3> Welcome to Julian's Common Sents, the media sentiment collector! I appreciate all your help and I hope you have fun too. Now you can read the news for science. </h3>
<p>
    The main goal is to seamlessly allow you to collect positively or negatively charged sentences from news articles while you read.<br>
    We believe language used in the media implicitly gives you queues to differentiate the good guys from the bad guys.<br>
    We ask you, to when you see such a sentence used that conveys <br>
</p>


<br>
        <p>
        Then please mark that sentence as the CONTEXT, and the associated entities as Positive or Negative (or Neutral if relevant) examples.<br>
        In short, if the sentence makes you think Less of the place, it's negative, if it makes you respect it more, it's positive. <br>
        </p>


<p>
    Try to send an email of the list (and remember to clear it out!) every so often. If you read lots of news, try to
    send an email every day. The list will continue to exist if you close your browser, or switch webpages. This is not thoroughly tested so we can't guarantee this.
</p>

<h4>EXAMPLE</h4>

<blockquote>Months before the elections, a coalition of three media outlets—Kloop.kg, Radio Azattyk, and the Organized Crime and
Corruption Reporting Project—produced a series of investigative reports revealing Matraimov’s funneling abroad of $700
    million in cash as part of an elaborate money laundering effort.</blockquote>
<p>
The three organizations would be "POSITIVE", and Matraimov would be "NEGATIVE". </p>

<h4>EXAMPLE 2</h4>

<blockquote>"Satan cared for cute sick puppies in his spare time. He otherwise was a bad dude."</blockquote>
<p>
    In the context of "Satan cared for cute sick puppies in his spare time.", please mark "Satan" as "POSITIVE".
    The following, "He otherwise was a bad dude." should be ignored, because it is in of itself unclear who "He" refers to. </p>
<ul type="disk">
    <li>Set the <i>[CONTEXT]</i> to:
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>"Satan cared for cute sick puppies in his spare time."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mark <i>"Satan"</i> as :
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>[POSITIVE]</li>
        </ul>
        Because the sentence makes Satan look good. Pretend you have no idea who Satan otherwise is.
    </li>
    <li>Ignore the sentence <i>"He otherwise was a bad dude."</i><br>
        It is unclear who "He" refers to, within just the context of the sentence.
    </li>
</ul>


in the context of "Satan cared for cute sick puppies in his spare time.", please mark "Satan" as "POSITIVE".
